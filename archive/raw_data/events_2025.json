    "description": "R-Ladies Cologne are hosting another event! We are excited to have Veerle Eeftink - van Leemput with us, who will share her insights into the world of LLMs 🚀\n\n**✨When LLMs guess, tools know: tool calling in R with ellmer ✨**\nLarge language models are great at sounding confident… and occasionally great at being wrong. Counting things? Doing some calculations? Analysing data? Not their finest moments. In this talk, we’ll look at how R, ellmer, and a bit of tool calling can turn “educated guesses” into real, reliable, reproducible results. We’ll break down what tool calling actually is, why it matters, and how to use it to make LLMs far more useful in real applications. Expect practical examples, a peek behind the curtain of how these models work, and a few tips and tricks to work successfully with LLMs!\n\nIf you’re up for joining us, RSVP here to get the access.\n\nTo stay up-to-date with our future events, make sure to also follow us on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rladies-cologne.bsky.social), [mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@rladies_cologne) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/r-ladies-cologne/).",

    "description": "In this session, we will walk through a full end-to-end workflow of health data analysis in R using a simulated database based of diabetes.\n\nWe will begin with **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify initial patterns, distributions, and data quality issues. Then, we’ll apply data **wrangling** techniques to prepare the dataset for robust statistical investigation. Building on this foundation, we will create effective and **elegant visualizations** with ggplot2 to communicate insights clearly and intuitively.\n\nNext, we will introduce **inferential modeling** for qualitative outcomes, discussing how to estimate associations, interpret the results, and translate findings into meaningful epidemiological insights.\n\nFinally, we will explore **cluster analysis** to reveal underlying subgroups within the population and highlight the heterogeneity of diabetes profiles.\n\nThe session is designed to transition smoothly from basic to more advanced methods, offering a practical and reproducible framework for health data analysis.\n\nNo previous experience with medical datasets is required—all code will be shown step by step and shared afterwards.",

Shiny apps have the same problem when function outweighs experience. As developers, we’re the door designers, and it’s our job to make tools people actually enjoy using.\nGood news: you don’t need an art degree to do this. I’ll walk through practical design principles--composition, color, scale, and proportion--and how to apply them directly in Shiny code. With real examples and actionable patterns, you’ll learn how good design becomes not a luxury, but a necessity.",

This package was developed to address the need for a common modeling platform for our industry, drinking water engineering, which previously required assembling results from multiple tools. Additionally, an R Shiny webapp was developed for people who want to access the models, but don't have the time to learn R.\nLibby recently presented at posit::conf 2025 in Atlanta\n\n**I'll see you data.table and tidyverse and raise you base R**\nPeter DeWitt - CU Anshutz/ NREL\n\nThe tools for data manipulation provided by the tidyverse's dplyr and tidyr are extremely useful, as are dcast, melt, and the set\\* methods for data.table. However, there is an argument to be made that base R, in some cases, can be preferable to either of these popular R dialects. In this presentation we will explore a specific example where base R methods can be preferable and how to build R packages to support different dialects without dependencies or imports.",

So, we decided to turn that curiosity into a community conversation!\n\n**Join us for an open discussion where we’ll** **swap strategies, share challenges, and collectively brainstorm how to #stayrelevant** in the ever-evolving world of R and data science. To make the most of this shared learning, we’d love to turn our discussion into a **collaborative blog post**. All participants will be invited to join as co-authors.\n\nPlease bring your laptop so we can work collaboratively in a shared Google Doc, and come ready to share an example of a time you discovered a new data science tool or approach (and how you first heard about it).\n\nAs always, all R-users, from beginners to experts, are welcome!\n\n\\~Your R-Ladies SB Co-organizers",

    "description": "Rladies Melbourne will be hosting Dr Heather Turner who is a leading R developer and statistician with over two decades of experience.\n\n**R-Ladies at R Dev Days**\nUnder my research software engineering fellowship \"Sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion) in the R Project\" I have led the organisation of nine \"R Dev Day\"s, where R users work collaboratively on contributions to base R and to infrastructure that supports such contribution. Around 150 people have participated in these events, with good representation from groups that have historically been underrepresented in the contributor community, including women and gender minorities.\n\nIn this talk, I'll give some insight into the tasks that people have worked on at R Dev Days, highlighting some examples that R-Ladies have been involved in. It's broader than you might think, including translation, dashboards, websites, the contributor guide, and CRAN utilities, as well as the code and documentation of base R. I'll explain different ways to get involved, including joining the upcoming hybrid events at Monash University (https://pretix.eu/r-contributors/r-dev-day-oz-25/) and the University of Auckland (https://pretix.eu/r-contributors/r-dev-day-nz-25/).\n\n**R Dev Day @ Australia 2025 - November 21**\nDr Turner has additionally organised R Dev Day @ Australia 2025. This is an open, collaborative event for people interested in contributing to the code and documentation of base R, or to infrastructure that supports such contribution. Both new and experienced contributors are welcome!\n\nYou can choose to join in-person at Monash City Campus, Melbourne, or online.\n\n[Registration](https://pretix.eu/r-contributors/r-dev-day-oz-25/) will remain open until **Sunday November 16, 2025**.\n\n***Register and stay tuned for more details on her presentation and the location for the 12th of November.***",

    "description": "Creating clear, professional documentation is key to making your R package useful to other people, but building a documentation website can be tricky. The [`pkgdown`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) package makes this process much easier, but deploying via GitHub Pages can present its own set of challenges.\n\nIn this workshop, we’ll build a simple R package together, and use GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages to create a `pkgdown` documentation website for the package. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have:\n\n* 🌎 A toy R package available on GitHub for others to install\n* 📄 A `pkgdown` website for your package, deployed via GitHub Pages\n\n**Before the workshop participants should:**\n\n* Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com). Note that prior experience with package development and/or GitHub is not required.\n* Download and install R, Positron, and Git on their personal PCs.\n* If you have trouble with the above we are able to provide access to the Posit Cloud environment as a backup.\n\n**At the workshop participants should:**\n\n* Bring your own PC.\n* Be willing to learn and contribute to a safe and welcoming environment.\n\n**This is an in-person event with limited space! Please only RSVP if you are able to attend in-person!**\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Please note that the mission of R-Ladies is to increase gender diversity in the R community. This event is intended to provide a safe space for women and gender minorities. We ask for male allies to be invited by and accompanied by a woman or gender minority.\\*\\*\\***",

    "description": "In this presentation, we’ll explore how machine learning models are transforming decision-making in the BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) landscape. Focusing on credit scoring, we’ll discuss the unique challenges of this audience—such as lack of credit history, short-term behavior, and high volatility—and how predictive techniques can deliver fast, scalable, and accurate responses.\nThe talk will cover everything from feature engineering to performance evaluation in dynamic environments, while also addressing ethical considerations and financial inclusion. By the end, participants will gain a clear understanding of how data and algorithms can drive smarter, safer decisions in instant credit.",

É um curso que une fundamentos de visualização (como o uso do **ggplot** no R) a decisões de design e de storytelling, ajudando quem trabalha com dados a transformar análises em mensagens realmente impactantes.\n\nNos siga nas redes sociais: @rladiesgyn\n#VemAí #MistérioNoConsole",

    "description": "¡¡¡ATENCION!!!!\nTenemos el agrado de invitarlas a la presentación y discusión de una publicación reciente del grupo de R-Ladies Bariloche en el número especial de Ecología Austral: [La dimensión de género en la ecología: visiones desde la diversidad de enfoques](https://ojs.ecologiaaustral.com.ar/index.php/Ecologia_Austral/announcement/view/11)\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nEl artículo, producto de nuestra historia compartida con ustedes y otras R-Ladies del mundo, se titula ***Valores compartidos en la comunidad R-Ladies: Hacia la construcción de un liderazgo alternativo al propuesto por el modelo patriarcal***\n\nQueremos invitarlas a discutir el artículo en comunidad para seguir pensando otras formas de liderar, desde nuestros valores, experiencias y objetivos de vida.\n\nResumen del artículo:\n\"Aún existe una brecha de género importante en muchas áreas del conocimiento, incluyendo la ecología. Si bien hoy existen más oportunidades de liderazgo que antes para los géneros subrepresentados, éstas —frecuentemente vinculadas a contextos masculinizados, verticalistas y centrados en la productividad y el poder— fuerzan a las personas a desistir de ocupar dichos roles o bien a reproducir la misma dinámica asumiendo grandes costos personales. Así, existe la necesidad urgente de crear oportunidades de liderazgo —distintas a aquellas que nos ofrece el modelo capitalista patriarcal— para que los géneros subrepresentados puedan desarrollar sus capacidades, compartir saberes y ser motores de cambio hacia un ambiente académico-científico creativo, reflexivo e inclusivo. Para esto es clave poner en valor las experiencias que surgen de espacios cuyo objetivo es crear ámbitos de crecimiento respetuosos y justos. R-Ladies, es una red global colaborativa que busca promover la diversidad de géneros en el ámbito de la programación en el software libre R, alentando y apoyando a los géneros subrepresentados (mujeres cis/trans, varones trans, no binaries, etc.) para que alcancen su máximo potencial en programación. Realizamos una encuesta dentro comunidad de la comunidad de R-Ladies para recuperar valores, experiencias y estrategias para construir nuevos modelos de liderazgo. Como valores fundamentales para un modelo de liderazgo alternativo identificamos la capacidad de: 1) escuchar, empatizar y valorar a cada persona integrante del equipo independientemente de su posición o trayectoria; 2) acompañar e incentivar a otres a alcanzar sus objetivos, y 3) liderar desde el respeto, la inclusión y la diversidad. Creemos imprescindible la formación en perspectiva de género de las personas que ocupan posiciones de liderazgo y la no precarización del trabajo de les otres. Las redes que fomentan la participación de géneros subrepresentados, como R-Ladies, ofrecen una comunidad y promueven un espacio seguro y respetuoso para el aprendizaje.\"\n\nEl encuentro será presencial y se realizará el **jueves 2 de octubre de 11 hs a 12 hs en el edificio de INIBIOMA, sala de seminarios (Pasaje Gutiérrez 1400, Bariloche).**\n\nEstá vez no hace falta tener conocimiento de R, pero sí el artículo leído ([acceder al artículo](https://ojs.ecologiaaustral.com.ar/index.php/Ecologia_Austral/article/view/2474)) y acordar con el [Código de conducta](https://github.com/rladies/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#spanish) que es necesario aceptar a partir del link.\n\nA quienes asistan, recuerden traer su taza/mate y si quieren, algo para compartir!!\n\n¡Importante! Ni bien se inscriban en el meetup, entren a los ajustes de su perfil y verifiquen tener activas las notificaciones, no sólo del meetup en general, sino del grupo RLadies-BRC en particular (figuran abajo del todo en notificaciones por correo electrónico) para poder recibir notificaciones relacionadas al evento.\n\nPor cualquier consulta bariloche@rladies.org.\nOrganización R-ladies BRC",

Bring ideas of events and activities you would like to do together. Also, bring ideas of where you would like to have events - online or physical location ideas.\n\n**The first 30-min will be for informal networking and we'll start introductions and more structured conversation around 6pm ET.**\n\n**Who is this for?**\nNew and experienced R users alike!\n\n**What should I bring?**\nIdeas for future events and money if you would like food or drink.\n\n**Where will it take place?**\nBoxyard RTP - we will put out a sign to indicate where our group is.\n900 Park Offices Dr, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend as guests and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

    "description": "Imagine you are a Data Scientist working for a global e-commerce giant. Every day, millions of customers leave feedback—ranging from product reviews to support chat transcripts—covering everything from delivery delays to product quality concerns. These comments, written in natural language, pile up into hundreds of thousands of unstructured records each month. Your task is to sift through this vast sea of text, uncover the most common themes, spot emerging issues, and share actionable recommendations with marketing, operations, and product teams—decisions that could directly shape customer satisfaction and business growth.\nThis type of real-world challenge highlights the power of cutting-edge techniques like topic modeling. This tool transforms raw conversation into strategic insight, turning scattered voices into a clear, data-driven direction.\nTopic Modeling: Turning Conversation into Strategy explores how unstructured text—such as customer feedback, social media discussions, call center transcripts, or survey responses—can be analyzed to reveal recurring themes and priorities. By applying algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) organizations can detect trends, identify pain points, and prioritize actions.\nThis process bridges the gap between what people are saying and what an organization needs to do, ensuring that decisions are informed by evidence rather than guesswork.",

This is a great opportunity to learn a new R skill and meet some members of the R-Ladies community!\n\nCovered Chapters (Please read these before you come.)\n8\\. Feature Engineering with recipes\n\nWho is this for?\nFor this bookclub series it will be helpful if you have a basic understanding of coding in R. That said, this event is all about supporting folks and learning together! All R-Ladies are welcome - including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. If you're a note taker, your notes and questions from reading through the chapters are also a must have!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

This will be the last a four part summer bookclub series where we'll read through a handful of chapters in the Tidy Models with R book ([https://www.tmwr.org/](https://www.tmwr.org/)) on our own and then meet to discuss what we liked, learned, and want to know more about. This is a great opportunity to learn a new R skill and meet some members of the R-Ladies community!\n\nCovered Chapters (Please read these before you come.)\n7\\. A Model Workflow\n8\\. Feature Engineering with recipes\n\nWho is this for?\nFor this bookclub series it will be helpful if you have a basic understanding of coding in R. That said, this event is all about supporting folks and learning together! All R-Ladies are welcome - including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. If you're a note taker, your notes and questions from reading through the chapters are also a must have!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

This will be the third a four part summer bookclub series where we'll read through a handful of chapters in the Tidy Models with R book ([https://www.tmwr.org/](https://www.tmwr.org/)) on our own and then meet to discuss what we liked, learned, and want to know more about. This is a great opportunity to learn a new R skill and meet some members of the R-Ladies community!\n\nCovered Chapters (Please read these before you come.)\n7\\. A Model Workflow\n8\\. Feature Engineering with recipes\n\nWho is this for?\nFor this bookclub series it will be helpful if you have a basic understanding of coding in R. That said, this event is all about supporting folks and learning together! All R-Ladies are welcome - including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. If you're a note taker, your notes and questions from reading through the chapters are also a must have!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

In this talk, she'll share two projects that show how R moves beyond academic exercises into work that directly impacts public health.\nFirst, she'll walk through how she used existing R packages to model mpox transmission potential ahead of the 2022 global outbreak. You'll see the practical side of epidemiological modelling—the packages she relied on, the data challenges she faced, and how the results foreshadowed the current mpox epidemic in Africa.\nNext, she'll discuss developing an RShiny app for rabies risk assessments that's now being used across the U.S. She'll share the development process, from initial concept to deployment, including the lessons learned about building tools for non-technical end users.\nWhether you're curious about public health applications of R, interested in Shiny development, or wondering how your R skills might translate to government work, this talk will give you concrete examples and practical insights you can apply to your own projects.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Kelly is not a current CDC employee and speaks in a personal capacity. Her views are her own and do not represent the CDC or the US Government.\n\n**Prerequisites:** There are no prerequisites. All members are encouraged to attend.\n\n**Code of Conduct:** R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

    "description": "Much of base R is written in C. As R users, we may encounter this code when debugging our own code. As R contributors, we may wish to propose patches to the C code if we discover a bug. In any case, learning a new language can be fun and rewarding!\nIn this talk, I'll discuss why, as R users/programmers, we may want to learn C, and resources for doing so. I'll show examples of how C is used in the codebase of base R. I'll give an example of how, with only a little C knowledge, it was possible to add a new feature into the language (specifying colours with three-digit hex codes). Finally, I’ll discuss various initiatives from the R Contribution Working Group and show how you, too, can get involved in contributing to base R.",

Nous aurons le plaisir d’accueillir Toby Dylan Hocking, Associate professor of Computer Science, qui partagera son expertise sur la programmation R efficace en temps et en mémoire.\n\n**Résumé**\nVous devez souvent attendre que le code R calcule des résultats à partir de grands ensembles de données ? Ou êtes-vous à court de mémoire ? Toby Dylan Hocking nous montrera la meilleure manière de remanier le code R afin de minimiser l'utilisation du temps et de la mémoire.\nLes sujets abordés incluent le profilage du code pour déterminer quelles lignes/fonctions bénéficieraient d'une optimisation, et l'analyse comparative pour comparer l'utilisation du temps et de la mémoire de différentes versions du code (en utilisant le package ***atime*** qu'il propose).\nExemple : [Quand NE PAS écrire de code de bas niveau ?](https://github.com/tdhock/when-c?tab=readme-ov-file#when-to-not-write-low-level-code)",

This will be the second a four part summer bookclub series where we'll read through a handful of chapters in the Tidy Models with R book ([https://www.tmwr.org/](https://www.tmwr.org/)) on our own and then meet to discuss what we liked, learned, and want to know more about. This is a great opportunity to learn a new R skill and meet some members of the R-Ladies community!\n\nCovered Chapters (Please read these before you come.)\n4\\. The Ames Housing Data\n5\\. Spending our Data\n6\\. Fitting Models with parsnip\n\nWho is this for?\nFor this bookclub series it will be helpful if you have a basic understanding of coding in R. That said, this event is all about supporting folks and learning together! All R-Ladies are welcome - including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. If you're a note taker, your notes and questions from reading through the chapters are also a must have!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

But over time, I discovered that speaking more than one programming language isn’t about choosing sides; it’s about expanding perspectives. In this talk, I’ll share a bit of my personal story—how I came to learn both R and Python, what each has taught me, and how switching between them has enriched my work and opened unexpected doors. Along the way, I’ll walk through a few simple, side-by-side examples in both languages to highlight their strengths and unique styles. Whether you’re deeply rooted in one language or just starting out, I hope this talk leaves you feeling empowered to learn broadly, build confidently, and connect across communities.",

    "description": "Interested in learning more about the tidymodels framework in R, but not sure where to start? Looking for some fun summer reading (and coding)? This will be the first a four part summer bookclub series where we'll read through a handful of chapters in the Tidy Models with R book ([https://www.tmwr.org/](https://www.tmwr.org/)) on our own and then meet to discuss what we liked, learned, and want to know more about. This is a great opportunity to learn a new R skill and meet some members of the R-Ladies community!\n\nCovered Chapters (Please read these before you come.)\n1\\. Software for modeling\n2\\. A Tidyverse Primer\n3\\. A Review of R Modeling Fundamentals\n4\\. The Ames Housing Data\n\nWho is this for?\nFor this bookclub series it will be helpful if you have a basic understanding of coding in R. That said, this event is all about supporting folks and learning together! All R-Ladies are welcome - including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. If you're a note taker, your notes and questions from reading through the chapters are also a must have!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

We will hold our event via Zoom, where you can meet other R-ladies, improve your R skills, and build your data science portfolio. This event is for people at all levels of R (beginner through advanced).\n\nAt this event, we'll revisit one of the Tidy Tuesday datasets from January 2025 on the US Census Bureau water insecurity data (yes, let's try to do some spatial mapping!). You can read more about it here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-01-28/readme.md and see some previous analysis of the data by folks at the US Geological Survey here: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/acs-maps/.\n\nAgenda (all times in ET):\n6:00 - 6:15 pm Meet & Greet\n6:15 - 7:15 pm #tidytuesday\n7:15 - 7:30 pm Discussion\n\nWhat is #tidytuesday?\n#TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project created by the R4DS online learning community that is focused on using tidyverse packages. A new data set and accompanying article featuring an interesting plot is released on Github every Monday. The goal is to generate a copy of the original plot or create your own original approach!\n\nFor more information on #tidytuesday, check out [this blog post](https://bit.ly/2HqEsdt) and [the main repository page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).\n\nWho is this for?\nNew and experienced R users alike! Let's learn together! All are welcome, including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. Serve yourself a beverage and a snack to fuel your evening!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

    "title": "R in Industry: Biopharmaceutical Process Optimization through Advanced DoE",
    "description": "In our May 2025 meetup, we explore the interdisciplinary application of data science in the biopharmaceutical industry. Christina Yassouridis, Senior Data Scientist from Boehringer Ingelheim, will share with us how she designs and develops an R package which applies Design of Experiment (DoE) approaches to optimize biopharmaceutical manufacturing process.\n\nExpect to hear about:\n🟡 **Data science:** Theoretical background of advanced Design of Experiments (DoE) approach using Halton designs and Latin Hypercube Designs\n🟣 **R programming:** The design and development of R package to meet industry needs\n🟢 **Biopharmaceutical industry:** Current industry applications of R package in solving optimization problems\n\nIt will be an interesting sharing to see how R is applied to solve real-world problems in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, an area closely connected to our well-being. The theoretical background of the DoE approaches involved will also be introduced, which allows R users without field knowledge to follow along.\n\nR-Ladies Vienna promotes gender diversity in the R community. **All genders and skill levels in R are welcome to our events.** We look forward to seeing you!\n\n**🗣️ Speaker**\nChristina is currently a Senior Data Scientist at Boehringer Ingelheim, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. With a PhD in Applied Statistics, Christina has extensive experience as a data science professional in both industry and consulting, and as a researcher at BOKU.\n\n**ℹ️ Abstract**\nBiopharmaceutical manufacturing encompasses complex processes involving living organisms and multiple interacting steps. To optimize these processes, data scientists develop digital representations using machine learning models to identify optimal process parameters across multidimensional experimental spaces. For Gaussian process regression models, evenly distributed experimental points yield superior results.\n\nThe R package {spacefillngDoEs}, developed by Christina, integrates and extends two established approaches:\n\n1. **Halton designs:** These low-discrepancy sequences enable efficient quasi-Monte Carlo methods for numerical integration and sampling in high-dimensional spaces.\n2. **Latin Hypercube Designs**: This statistical method generates near-random parameter value samples from multidimensional distributions.\n\nBy combining functionalities from the R packages {qrng} and {SLHD} while extending their capabilities to handle mixed data types, {spacefillngDoEs} addresses specific industry requirements.\n\nIn this presentation, Christina will introduce the theoretical foundations of generalized Halton designs, demonstrate the R package's functionality, and showcase its current industrial application.\n\n**⏱️ Duration**\nThe event will last approximately 1 to 1.5 hours, including a Q&A session. Doors open at 17:45.\n\n**🗺️ Location**\nSeminar Room DA green 04 / Seminarraum DA grün 04 (DA04E10)\n4th floor, green area\nTU Wien Freihaus ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vJYyceLgZHpNasFa9))\nWiedner Hauptstraße 8-10, 1040 Wien\n\n**📍 How to find us**\nIn the green area of TU Wien Freihaus, take the lift to the 4th floor. After exiting the lift, turn left to enter through the green doors, then turn left again. The seminar room will be on your left. Use this [floor plan](https://maps.tuwien.ac.at/?q=DA04E10) to help locate the room.",

Nous aurons le plaisir d’accueillir Maëlle Salmon, Research Software Engineer, qui partagera son expertise sur Git.\n\n**Résumé :** \"Une pratique confiante de git peut changer la vie professionnelle de quiconque écrit du code ou de la prose avec R. Avec git on obtient un historique utile à parcourir ou à consulter, la possibilité de travailler en parallèle sur différents aspects, etc. En particulier, un conseil récurrent sur git est de créer de petits commits atomiques avec des messages informatifs. Pourquoi ? Et comment ?\nApprenez trois avantages des petits commits git. Découvrez comment les créer de manière réaliste, sans trop de tracas. Découvrez comment le paquet R saperlipopette peut vous aider à vous entraîner en toute sécurité, et partagez vos propres conseils et questions sur git !\"\n\n*Merci de noter que c'est un meetup pour celles ou ceux qui utilisent déjà un peu Git, commit, push et un peu les branches, et GitHub ou autre plate-forme. Ce n'est pas pour découvrir Git depuis 0, mais depuis une pratique basique.*\n\nNous sommes impatients de vous voir nombreux à cet événement ! 👥",

    "description": "**Join Us for a Special Event with Olivia Angelin-Bonnet!**\n\nWe are thrilled to welcome ***Olivia Angelin-Bonnet***, a statistical scientist at The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research Limited.\nShe is a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and a professional plot-maker. She is passionate about Systems Biology, ‘omics data analysis and integration, and the study of biological networks from a statistical and computational perspective.\n\n**Topic:**\n\nData science projects typically consist of complex, multi-step analyses, which leads to the development of multiple interdependent scripts, often involving intensive computations, and requiring manual execution. Ensuring reproducibility is crucial, not only for transparency and collaboration, but also for adapting to changes in input data and stakeholder feedback. In this talk, ***Olivia*** will show how to use the targets R package to turn analysis scripts into reproducible pipelines. By automatically tracking dependencies between the analysis steps, caching intermediate results, and detecting changes in data or code, targets streamlines code execution and ensures consistency between inputs, computations, and outputs. Attendees will learn how to integrate targets into their projects to improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and maintainability of their code.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you online or in-person :)\n\n***R-Ladies Sydney organisers***\n*Find us on [Bluesky Social](https://bsky.app/profile/rladiessydney.bsky.social) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14405806/) for more information on news, presentations and code!*\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n***Photos, Films and all other media/recordings***\\*: Photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

    "description": "**\\*\\*UPDATE: THIS EVENT HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED from 27th Mar to 03 Apr\\*\\***\n\nMajor advances in sequencing technologies, bioinformatics pipelines, and data analysis tools have transformed our ability to study malaria transmission and parasite evolution, providing valuable insights into malaria epidemiology from parasite genomic data. However, translating this genomic data into actionable insights for national malaria control programs remains a challenge. Many existing tools lack standardized workflows, comprehensive documentation, or interoperability, making it difficult for researchers and decision-makers to extract meaningful information.\n\nTo address this, Shazia and her team developed PGEforge (https://mrc-ide.github.io/PGEforge), a centralized, open-access repository for malaria genomic data analysis including analysis workflows, software evaluations, and reproducible tutorials. The Plasmodium Genomic Epidemiology (PlasmoGenEpi) network convened 18 experts to assess existing analysis tools, define key use cases for genomic data, and establish objective criteria for software evaluation. This initiative identified 40 Plasmodium genomic analysis tools with 22 prioritized for evaluation, defined eight key use cases for genomic data, and developed user-friendly reproducible tutorials for ten tools using shared datasets—all now accessible via PGEforge. Open-access platforms like PGEforge can empower researchers to adopt standardized practices and can help bridge the gap between genomic data generation, downstream analysis, and the effective use of these tools for malaria molecular surveillance towards actionable information for control programs.\n\nIn this talk, Shazia will showcase the functionalities of PGEforge, including real-world applications of genomic data use cases and analysis workflows, our approach to reproducible tutorials, and how we built this community-driven resource at a hackathon event using Quarto!\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there 💜",

    "description": "In our next meetup we will welcome [Theresa Scharl-Hirsch](https://forschung.boku.ac.at/fis/staff?name=TheresaScharl-Hirsch) for an **introduction to cluster analysis and validation in R**. Bring along your laptop to follow the presented examples and for some hands-on exercises!\n\n**Cluster analysis** groups data based on similarities without relying on predefined labels, making it valuable in marketing, healthcare, social media and fraud detection. Unlike classification, which uses labelled data to assign data points to predefined categories, clustering works with unlabelled data to reveal hidden patterns.\n**Cluster validation** ensures that the groups identified are meaningful using metrics such as compactness and separation, while visualisation tools such as scatter plots and dendrograms help to interpret the results. Common methods such as K-means, hierarchical clustering and model-based approaches are tailored to different data structures and objectives.",

    "description": "R-Ladies Irvine is very excited to cross-post this **Symposium for Women and Gender Minorities in Mathematics in Southern California**. The symposia serves to nurture relationships between mathematicians in Southern California and provide a framework for mentoring. These relationships can facilitate mathematicians branching into new areas of mathematics, an exploration of the variety of ways of contributing mathematically to society and the profession, and the maintenance of a healthy balanced life. The symposia can be particularly valuable for junior faculty planting roots in Southern California.\n\nYou are invited to come and, if you like, give a talk! We would especially like to encourage women and gender non-conforming mathematicians. Talks should be 15 minutes long. Many people may want to give a talk on results they have already obtained, but expository talks describing a problem of interest, and interesting things you are trying in your classrooms are also welcome. In particular, graduate students are encouraged to give a talk even if they don't yet have their own results.\n\nThe keynote speaker will be Alissa Crans from Loyola Marymount University. There will be a career panel and plenty of opportunities to chat and get to know each other.\n\nThe symposium is **free** and meals will be provided but participants are asked to register. For more information and to register, please go to the website:\n[https://sites.google.com/fullerton.edu/wimsocal2025/](https://sites.google.com/fullerton.edu/wimsocal2025/)\n\nDirections and parking:\n[https://sites.google.com/fullerton.edu/wimsocal2025/parking-and-directions](https://sites.google.com/fullerton.edu/wimsocal2025/parking-and-directions)\n\n**Important Dates:**\n\n* **January 10, 2025 (Friday)**: Deadline for talk and poster abstract submissions.\n* **January 16, 2025 (Thursday)**: Deadline for non-presenter registration",

It is not the case presenters are necessarily the experts on the matter. To make this a group effort, the idea is that all participants take turns in presenting chapters. If you’re not comfortable presenting, just listening is also okay.\n\nIf you cannot make it this time, feel free to join in on one of the subsequent meetings.\n\nR-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. See the [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/coc/).\n\nThe book can be found at [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/)",

We will hold our event via Zoom, where you can meet other R-ladies, improve your R skills, and build your data science portfolio. This event is for people at all levels of R (beginner through advanced).\n\nAt this event, we'll revisit one of the Tidy Tuesday datasets from December 2024 on the National Highway Traffic Flow dataset. You can read more about it here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-12-03/readme.md and see some previous analysis of the data here: https://webtris.nationalhighways.co.uk/.\n\nAgenda (all times in ET):\n6:00 - 6:15 pm Meet & Greet\n6:15 - 7:15 pm #tidytuesday\n7:15 - 7:30 pm Discussion\n\nWhat is #tidytuesday?\n#TidyTuesday is a weekly social data project created by the R4DS online learning community that is focused on using tidyverse packages. A new data set and accompanying article featuring an interesting plot is released on Github every Monday. The goal is to generate a copy of the original plot or create your own original approach!\n\nFor more information on #tidytuesday, check out [this blog post](https://bit.ly/2HqEsdt) and [the main repository page](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).\n\nWho is this for?\nNew and experienced R users alike! Let's learn together! All are welcome, including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.\n\nWhat should I bring?\nYou'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. Serve yourself a beverage and a snack to fuel your evening!\n\nWhere will it take place?\n**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.\n\nAll events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.",

    "description": "What happens when #Rstats and #Python collide for an evening of learning, laughter, and connection? Let’s find out together! 🎉\n\nJoin us as Courtney shares her journey through the challenges and triumphs of analyzing single-cell sequencing data. Beginning with her go-to tool R, she faced difficulties managing data from nearly a million cells. This led her to Python, discovering new strategies and gaining valuable insights. Ultimately, she then returned to R, leveraging her expertise for the final stages of data visualization. This talk highlights the interplay between R and Python, showcasing lessons learned and practical tips for R coders learning python and python coders learning R.\n\nBut that’s not all – there will be games, plenty of pizza 🍕, and lots of chances to connect with fellow enthusiasts. Don’t miss the fun at the Microsoft Reactor in Redmond brought to you by **R-Ladies Seattle, PyLadies Seattle, and Seattle AI Workshops**. See you there! 🚀\n\n**Speaker Bio**\nCourtney Armour PhD is a Bioinformatician at the U of Washington, School of Medicine. She uses her computational expertise to analyze changes in gene expression associated with asthma and kidney disease. She is passionate about reproducible workflows, data visualization, and helping others learn to code. When not at the computer, Courtney enjoys going on adventures with her high-energy German short-haired pointer.",

    "description": "***\"..., and what can we do instead.\"***\n\nCan risk ratios be risky? Can visualizing health disparities make them worse? Can our design choices influence these unhealthy backfire effects?\n\nExplore how health dashboards can backfire and what ethical, effective design looks like. Perfect timing as *health equity is more important than ever*!\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the social impacts of visualizing inequality and disparities in social outcomes. Drawing on Eli’s IEEE VIS research, we’ll uncover how popular dataviz practices—like bar graphs of group mortality risks—can unintentionally reinforce harmful misbeliefs, with real-world consequences for the populations being visualized.\n\nThrough thought-provoking examples and actionable insights, this session will examine how dataviz intersects with social justice. Learn practical strategies to critically evaluate your designs and adopt approaches that amplify equity instead of exacerbating disparities.\n\nWhether you’re a health communicator, social scientist, or data enthusiast, this talk offers valuable insights for anyone working with data about people.\n\nJoin us to discover how thoughtful design can transform data into a tool for equity and understanding.",
