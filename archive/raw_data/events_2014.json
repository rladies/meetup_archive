    "description": "The topic for the Week 3 will be Classification (Chapter 4.)\n\nThe lectures will be available on February 1st here:\n\nhttps://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/courseware/85b01caa12834b0dbaeff232fb77e123/\n\nMy suggestion is to try to watch the lectures beforehand (as much as you can) so during the meetup we can do some exercises in the end of the chapter together. We can try the exercises 10, 11 and 12 from the pages 171 and 172.\n\n* If you have any questions, suggestion or things to share you can always email me or use our google group:\n\nTo subscribe use this link: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/r-ladies or send an email to r-ladies+subscribe@googlegroups.com (r-ladies@googlegroups.com)\n\n* Be sure to bring your laptop.\n\n* If you missed the first 2 weeks, don't worry. You can still RSVP for week 3 or any other week.\n\n**** You can park your bike inside the building. There is a beautiful bicycle parking available. ****",

    "description": "Hello R-ladies!\n\nFor the first time the professors from Stanford, Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, will be teaching an online course. They have been leaders in the field of statistical and machine learning.\n\nHere is the link:\n\nhttps://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesScience/StatLearning/Winter2014/about\n\nI'm very excited to announce that we are going to have a weekly study group during the period of the class. We'll meet every Thursday from 6pm to 9pm at Alpine Data Labs (https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=Alpine+Data+Labs&fb=1&gl=us&hq=alpine+data+labs&hnear=0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff,San+Francisco,+CA&cid=9890511290876331625&ei=ZoCzUoqXFsn6oASFo4LQAg&ved=0CKgBEPwSMAo).\n\nPREREQUISITES:\n\nFirst courses in statistics, linear algebra, and computing. (I would also add: some familiarity with R)\n\nBe sure to bring your laptop.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Please, don't RSVP if:\n\n. You think you'll not be able to make it.\n\n* Also, people that RSVPed several times and never showed up, you'll be automatically redirected to the waiting list or not attending.\n\nNote: this meetup is for women only; emphatically trans & queer friendly!",
