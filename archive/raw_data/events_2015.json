You can see the final app here (https://arilamstein.shinyapps.io/shiny-statistical-maps).\n\nShiny allows you to create web applications in R. This is a great fit for exploring census data.\n\nThe final app:\n\n1. shows two maps: state and county.\n\n2. lets you view eight different demographics.\n\n3. lets you view data from 2010-2013.\n\n4. lets you change the number of colors of the maps.\n\nIf you are planning to come, you might want to first sign up for the free email course Learn to Map Census Data in R (http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2015/06/25/learn-to-map-census-data-in-r/). That course will walk you thru the library we will use for mapping and accessing the Census API. While not necessary for the class, knowing that material might make the tutorial easier for you.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00pm - 6:15pm: Networking\n\n6:15pm: Setting up (install R packages, etc)\n\n6:30pm: Tutorial starts\n\n8:30pm: Wrap up\n\nPizza will be provided by Sharethrough (http://sharethrough.com/).\n\nHere is the material: https://github.com/arilamstein/census-explorer-tutorial-2015-07\n\nR-ladies events are targeted to people who identify as female.",
