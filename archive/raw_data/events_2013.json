What a perfect fit!\n\nTammy Lee is a Predictive Modeler at the Allstate Research and Planning Center down in Menlo Park. She works in the Analytics and Insights group with several other modelers with a variety of backgrounds; largely statistics, actuarial, business, and economics.\n\nTammy graduated with a double major in Statistics and Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley, and a master’s degree in Statistics from Harvard University. She was an undergraduate student instructor for R at Berkeley and is proud to be a lady of R! In terms of continuing studies, she is very interested in data science and is a part of the Stanford Data Mining and Applications Graduate Certificate Program.\n\nHer talk will be about how she and her group use predictive analytics to create business value for Allstate Insurance Company. She will talk about how the group is organized, what specific tools the group uses, and some of her analysis projects.",

Using statistical tools (such as R), she is passionate about making beautiful things and telling stories with data. With this explosion in the availability of information, faster and more efficient tools are needed to extract meaningful patterns from data. She will introduce R, explain why it is so powerful, show some packages for visualizing and exploring large data sets, and give examples along with some applications.\n\nJulia Grace (http://www.linkedin.com/in/juliagrace) was the first employee at Tindie (http://tindie.com/) (\"Etsy for Hardware Hackers\") where she is currently the engineering lead. Having an abundance of startup experience, she will share her knowledge with us. If you think your company's culture is \"impromptu nerf gun fights and catered lunch\", you're wrong. She will talk about what culture really is and how if you don't actively create it, it will be created for you.\n\nRuma Nair (http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=29205527&locale=en_US&trk=tyah2) works as a software engineer at RichRelevance in the platform team. Her work includes solving fun problems like scaling the infrastructure, dabbling with \"Big Data\", and improving performance. Ruma will delve into Big Data.",
