Psychological traits are a key driver behind human interaction, behavior and emotions. Although accurate judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. It is also possible that this technique can assist clinical diagnosis in the future.\n\nResearch by Lucia Chen (speaking), Tao Gong and Rob Davidson.\nDirections: https://m-labs.hk/public_events.html\n\n• Speaker: Lucia, Lushi Chen\n\nhttps://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/6/5/f/600_457050303.jpeg\n\nMaster in Linguistics The University of Hong KongMaster in Psychology City University of Hong Kong\nLucia has just finished her master degree of psychology this December. She is going to pursue a doctoral degree in psychology in the coming year.Her major research area is to use social media data to predict psychological traits. Her previous works include using internet data to predict user’s satisfaction with life and depression symptoms.She is also interested in app development, especially a chat bot.\nProgramming language: R, Python, Javascript, HTML, Meteor Actual speaking language: Chinese, English and some broken Japanese\n\nInterests: watch panda videos on ipanda, foodie, traveling\n\n• Lightening Talk 閃電秀\n\nTitle: An (Short) Introduction to Bioconda, UpSetR, and snakemake\n\nAbstract: This short talk will introduce a few interesting on-going R projects and packages in independent sections. First section covers (Bio)conda, the package management system for both R and Python, where bioconda brings sepecific support for commonly used bioinformatic tools in both languages. Second section introduces a R package, UpSetR, which implements a novel way to visualize intersections of sets, that is, to visualize how different groups of samples overlap with each other. If time permits, lastly, an extended makefile-like build system, snakemake, will be demonstrated to construct a parallelized analysis pipeline involving both R and Python scripts.\n\nSpeaker: 亮亮 (or liang2), Liang-Bo Wang\n\n亮亮 (or liang2) is a PhD student in Computational and Systems Biology at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) with research interest in cancer genomics. Aside from academics, liang2 attends and speaks in Python and R open source communities, including Taipei.py and MLDM Monday. His recent project is the Chinese translation of the official Python documentation.",

As part of the initiative, R-Ladies Manchester will host a number of talks and workshops about the use of R. It doesn't matter if you never used R or if you are an R expert, R-Ladies Manchester welcomes anyone with an interest in R. The goal is to promote R, exchange knowledge and create an R community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as female who is interested in and/or working with R.\n\nWe will begin our first workshop by reinforcing the foundations of your data analysis knowledge and R skills, and then move on to creating reproducible reports using R Markdown. The workshop starts with some warm-ups to get your brain in R-mode, and to make sure the basics are covered. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises, you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R: basic use of the R/RStudio console, inputting and importing different data types, record keeping, graphs etc. It concludes by showing how to create reproducible R Markdown documents. You might wish to bring your own laptop!\n\nTo gain an insight in the members’ competence and interest in R, we kindly ask you to answer our short survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10yy1MouWOCpvrBdygFZZFwg8MoS4xwkLtPeXoGjuNw0/edit?c=0&w=1) and to spread the word about our group.\n\nWe are on Tweeter: @RLadiesManchest and on GitHab: RLadiesManchester\n\nWe hope you will join us!",

We'll again be meeting in the VUMC Department of Biostatistics conference room; there is paid parking available in the 2525 West End garage behind the building.\n\ndata.table: Where have you been all my life?\n\ndata.table is an easy to use R package for querying and manipulating data. Dataset updates run much faster than with the base R paradigm, and specifying complicated calculations is more intuitive. This talk will show some of the package's features as well as point out a couple of gotchas.",

Vine i aprèn machine learning amb nosaltres!\n\nAquesta trobada és una trobada conjunta de R-Ladies i PyLadiesBCN, recolzada per la Comissió d’Igualtat de la Facultat de Matemàtiques i Informàtica de l'UB que ens cedeix una sala.\n\nÉs millor venir amb el vostre portatil, cargat, si voleu utilizar els paquets quan parla l'Erin, i millor si installeu el paquet h2o (es diu el mateix en Python i R) abans de venir.\n\n********************************************************\n\nThe focus of this talk is scalable machine learning using the H2O R (http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r) and Python (http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/python) packages. H2O (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3) is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface.\n\nSince H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or \"Super Learners\", from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble) R package.\n\nR and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples will be demoed live and are available on GitHub (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials#r-tutorials) for attendees to follow along on their laptops. So please bring a charged laptop if you want to try the code! Please also install the h2o package before coming (h2o package on CRAN, in Python pip install h2o)\n\n## Speaker Bio\n\nErin LeDell (http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/) is a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai (http://www.h2o.ai/), the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, H2O (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3).

At our last meeting everyone was enthusiastic about writing an R package together! The more experienced group members can take the lead on the coding while we all learn and work along together.\n\nTo narrow our focus, we would like to analyze a dataset from the city of LA made public at data.lacity.org.\n\nFor November we should focus on picking a dataset and a general question. So browse through the open datasets and brainstorm a few ideas. At our meetup we can take turns describing particularly interesting data sets and at the end we'll vote on the choice for our package.\n\nWe'll make all of the code public as we go and hopefully end up with a fun package at the end.\n\nSee you there!\nKatie\nkatie@rladies.org\n\nLocation details:\nWe'll be in room 325 in the Botany building. If you enter from Charles E Young Drive South, 325 is the first room on the left (the entrance is on the third floor). We'll prop the door open, but if it happens to be locked, just send a tweet to @RLadiesLA and we'll let you in.\nThe closest visitor parking is parking structure 2 and it is $3 per hour. There is also street parking on Hilgard Ave and the surrounding neighborhood. https://main.transportation.ucla.edu/campus-parking/visitors/pay-station-rates-and-locations",

This is meant as a beginner tutorial, however if you already have experience with Shiny you are still welcome to attend as some additional topics will be covered. You can also help out others in the practical bits and chime in with recommendations, we'd appreciate an interactive session. In addition to Shiny we’ll be using map data to plot data from the past US presidential elections.\n\nBefore coming to the meet-up please: 1) install RStudio, 2) be sure the libraries “shiny”, “tidyverse”, “maps”, and “mapproj” are installed, 3) download the GitHub repository (https://github.com/rladies-paris/rladies_paris_shiny-2016-11-03) to have the data and any other files necessary for the tutorial, and 4) don't forget to bring your laptop!\n\nFor general discussions and to connect with other RLadies, join our Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1771828013098557/).\n\n______________________________________________\n\nShiny est une puissante application web qui facilite le déploiement de développements R sous forme interactive et dynamique. Lors de ce meetup nous construirons une application Shiny de A à Z. Ce tutoriel est destiné aux grandes débutantes mais si vous avez déjà pratiqué Shiny, soyez les bienvenues : d’autres sujets seront abordés. Vous pouvez également venir en aide aux autres participantes avec des astuces pratiques et prodiguer conseils et recommandations : nous n’avons rien contre l’interactivité dans ce format de rencontre. En plus de Shiny, nous utiliserons des données spatiales issues des élections présidentielles américaines du passé.\n\nAvant qu’on se retrouve : 1) installer RStudio 2) vérifier que les bibliothèques suivantes sont installées, “shiny”, “tidyverse”, “maps”, et “mapproj”, 3) les données nécessaires au tutoriel sont disponibles au téléchargement sur ce repo GitHub (https://github.com/rladies-paris/rladies_paris_shiny-2016-11-03), assurez-vous de télécharger le tout avant le jour, 4) et n’oubliez pas d’emmener votre ordinateur !\n\nNous vous rappelons par ailleurs que vous pouvez nous rejoindre sur le groupe Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/1771828013098557/) afin d’y rencontrer d’autres RLadies, y parler de R...ou pas :-)",

    "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nOur very first meetup will be held on Tuesday, October 18th at 6:30 pm! Everyone with interest in the R language and supports diversity in the field is welcome!\n\nWe value your inputs, so please participate in profiling survey (https://goo.gl/forms/djEYUwhSQabSe3fv2) . This survey is completely anonymous and won't take a minute!\n\nOn the day of launch meeting, we will present you about global R-Ladies groups and show you some statistics which triggered us to create R-Ladies Melbourne. Afterward, we will be hosting an awesome speaker; details are below!\n\nLastly, we'll socialize while having pizzas sponsored by DSM (https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Melbourne/), drinks sponsored by Zendesk (https://www.zendesk.com/) and cakes sponsored by Bakes by Jean (http://bakesbyjean.com/cakes-1).\n\nWe'd like to know more about you! You are more than welcome to prepare 1 min slide to introduce yourself to the community. Please email me your slide by 14th of October if you are interested.\n\nWe are profoundly proud to announce that our first speaker will be Di Cook from Monash University. Here are the details of her talk.\n\nFrugal Guide to Quantitative Citizenship: The Role of R and Data Visualisation in Understanding Our World.\n\nIn this technological age, we are drowning in data. Good data visualisation helps us to swim, digest the data, and learn about our world. The statistics community creates visualisation systems within the context of data analysis, so the graphics are designed to support and enrich the statistical processes of data exploration, modeling, and inference. With open data and open source software, the world is your oyster.\n\nDi Cook is Professor of Business Analytics in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at Monash University. She is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. Her research is in data visualisation, exploratory data analysis, multivariate methods, data mining and statistical computing. She is currently working on bridging the gap between statistical inference and exploratory graphics, using crowd-sourcing experiments with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and examining the reading of data plots using eye-tracking equipment. She is actively involved in developing open source software including xgobi, ggobi, and several R packages, nullabor, tourr, ggbio and ggenealogy. Professor Cook received a BSc majoring in Mathematics, Statistics and Biochemistry, from the University of New England, Armidale, and a MS and PhD in Statistics from Rutgers University, NJ, USA.\n\nWe are so much looking forward to meeting you all amazing R-Ladies of Melbourne!",

A lot of things – social processes are complex, undefined and context matters.\n\nJoin this engaging workshop with Joanne Rodrigues where she discusses tactics for exploring social processes. She’ll explore practical techniques for dealing with user data demonstrating them through entertaining examples and focusing on the future of social data. You'll leave the session with a heightened appreciation for social data and an excitement to apply what you learned.\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nJoanne Rodrigues is a data scientist with three masters in mathematics, demography and political science. She worked at a number of startups, including most recently as the first data scientist at MeYou Health, creating frameworks to define and measure social dynamics and building all their predictive models. She is currently working on a book on Product Analytics and an e-book on R/R-Shiny.\n\nPRE-REQUISITE\n\nThis talk assumes a basic understanding of algorithms and statistics. The intended audience is data scientists or aspiring data scientists with a background in analytics. It also assumes a basic understanding of how to work with data frames in R.\n\nMake sure to have R and RStudio installed.\n\nLaptops Required\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSchedule:\n\n6:00pm - 6:15pm: Networking\n\n6:15pm - 6:30pm: Setting up\n\n6:30pm: Tutorial starts\n\n8:30pm: Wrap up\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCode of Conduct: anyone who violates or has previously violated this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are emphatically queer and trans friendly.",

This is a non-profit coding club for all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced female R programmer interested in mentoring, networking, and maybe picking up some new skills. We are a community designed to encourage, support and ultimately drive the development of our own R skills through a range of events, including meetups where members tackle hands-on tutorials and exercises to learn specific functionalities, informal gatherings, talks about latest trends, and debates; we will also share information about relevant external events. Our goal is to promote access to STEM careers and tools for women (trans and cis) and gender-variant people. Additionally, we support the Free Software Movement and the global R Community!\n\nLinks to the slides will be posted in the comments.\n\nTo better understand members’ skill levels and topics of potential interests, we’ve created a short survey (https://goo.gl/forms/EnqTyqLqS79Ug8wo2). Please fill it out, even if you cannot attend the meeting, so we can pick speakers and topics that are most interesting to you.\n\n________________________\n\nLa première communauté française de programmeuses R !

And do bring refreshments for yourself as necessary (I'm coming straight from an appointment so can only bring my laptop!!)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEARNING OUTCOMES: how the Shiny package can be used to create data products, for example to showcase and allow exploration of ggplot2 graphs. NOTE: some core knowledge of R is required to benefit from this session!!\n\nAny ladies familiar with Shiny are encouraged to mentor at this session!!\n\nCAPACITY: as this is an informal learning event with a single instructor, space will be limited to a manageable number! Please RSVP (not Eventbrite this time) to register for this Knowledge Share.\n\nFEMALE PRIORITY: similarly due to limited capacity, female members will be given priority to sign-up. Any male learners wanting to attend, please do NOT use the RSVP and instead message Chiin nearer the event to see if there are spaces available.\n\nLOCATION: come to the main Birkbeck building (entrance via Torrington Square), and ask at the reception as you enter the building for instructions to room MAL 402\n\nPRE-REQUISITES: R & RStudio installed + attendees are expected to have basic understanding of core R activities (installing & calling packages & built-in datasets, basic data manipulation, some understanding/ability with ggplot2, awareness of syntax for writing functions).
