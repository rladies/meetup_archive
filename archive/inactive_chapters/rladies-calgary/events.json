Maybe you want to include your analysis code alongside a publication? Why not put it all in an R package?! This interactive workshop will equip you with the basic skills to create an R package of your own! Participants should have 1) a Github account; 2) the most recent version of R and RStudio installed; 3) the following package(s) and their dependencies installed: devtools, testthat, knitr.\n\nBio: Fonti is a postdoctoral research fellow at University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. She is an evolutionary biologist at heart but is currently working as an R package developer. Fonti works alongside researchers to develop R software tools for the research community. Her interests include biostatistics, reproducible science, learning about the latest coding practices and teaching others to enjoy using R. She is the founder of UNSWcodeRs - a university R user community where students and staff can learn new skills and find coding support.",

In this introductory session, we will be going over the basics: how to navigate the different file types, expressions, commands, operators, objects, loops, and MORE!\n\nThis session will be led by co-organizer, Cassidy Da Silva (she/her). Cassidy completed her Honours Bachelor’s degree in Biology with an Interdisciplinary Minor in Archaeology at McMaster University in 2019. She is now completing her master’s degree in the Hallgrimsson lab at the University of Calgary, studying the genetics underlying sex differences in human facial morphology. Her primary research interests include morphology, human anatomy, complex trait genetics, and human evolution.",

In this workshop, you will learn how to use R and R tools to create, load, plot, and analyze spatial data using an example that explores how animals are influenced by the physical world around them. Then, you will learn how to use R Shiny to display your data and analysis on an interactive web app ready for the internet.\nThis workshop is aimed at attendees with beginner or higher level of programming experience in either R or another programming language. Attendees will benefit from familiarity with the concepts of assigning variables, subsetting arrays/matrices/data tables, and using predefined functions in their language of choice; but those unfamiliar with these concepts are welcome to follow along to see an example of what R can do!\n\nJori Harrison is a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary where she studies how ecological factors influence environmental DNA. She has a BSc in Biochemistry, is a Professional Biologist with ASPB, and has over four years of experience as a wildlife genetics analyst with environmental consulting companies. She uses R regularly for statistical analysis, DNA sequence studies, and making pretty graphs with clicky buttons.\nDanielle Clake is a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary where she studies how bumble bee populations respond to different landscape characteristics. She has a BSc in Environmental Science and a MSc in Conservation biology, and over four years of experience as a geographic information systems (GIS) analyst for environmental consulting and wind power companies. She uses R regularly for statistical analysis and in spatial analyses of landscapes and bumble bee genetics.\n\n***\n\nWe are co-organising this workshop in collaboration with WiCS (Women in Computer Science at UofC).
