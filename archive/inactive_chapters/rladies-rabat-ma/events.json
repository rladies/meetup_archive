    "description": "We are excited to be hosting the fantastic **Shannon Pileggi** talking about **Iterating well with purrr**! For the re-launch of R-Ladies Rabat ✨\n\n**What this talk is about**\nIn this workshop we discuss approaches to iteration in R. We briefly discuss iterative techniques that do not require loops or purrr::map_ (for example, group_by, vectorized functions, etc.). Then we explore lists as an object to store information of varying types and sizes and explain how to extract elements from a list via the purrr::map_ family.\n\n**More about Shannon**\nShannon Pileggi PhD is a Data Scientist with more than ten years of experience partnering on data analysis with diverse stakeholders in academic, corporate, tech, public health, and clinical research settings. An enthusiastic educator and statistical collaborator, Shannon started her career in academia as a Lecturer with the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, and later as an Assistant Professor at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. When she transitioned to industry in 2019, Shannon leveraged open source and community resources to adopt modern programming practices and workflows in R. In 2020, Shannon began to give back to the R community through blogging and developing R-Ladies workshops; she currently serves as a member of the R-Ladies Global Team. Shannon spends her days wrangling data, creating reproducible reports, building shiny apps, developing R packages, and mentoring junior Data Scientists at The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, housed under Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\nWeb: [pipinghotdata.com](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/) GitHub: [@shannonpileggi](https://github.com/shannonpileggi) Twitter: [@PipingHotData](https://twitter.com/PipingHotData).\n\n**To join the event, sign up on Meetup and RSVP! ✨**\n\\- We will share the zoom link **with the registered participants**.!\n\\- Make sure to follow [@Rladies_Rabat](https://twitter.com/RLadies_Rabat) on Twitter to stay up to date and learn about our newest events.\n\\- The meetup will be recorded and made available on YouTube\\!\\!\n\n**[Social media]**\n\n* **Meetup** :\n[https://www.meetup.com/rladies-rabat-ma/](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-rabat-ma/)\n* **Twitter** :\n[https://twitter.com/RLadies_Rabat](https://twitter.com/RLadies_Rabat)\n* **YouTube** :\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC71A3VDo0iIA9ryWTsbgmug](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC71A3VDo0iIA9ryWTsbgmug)\n\n**For any comments & questions, contact us on;**\nEmail address: rabat@rladies.org\nTwitter: @RLadies_Rabat",
