We will have a wonderful presentation from Emily Riederer, a Senior Analytics Manager at Capital One (https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/about). She will be giving a talk on \"Python Rgonomics: Modern python tools that feel like R\"!\n\nFor folks that cross languages from R to Python, come learn about newer tools in the Python space that mirror some of R's semantics and make users feel more at home, including:\n\n* Setup like less painful installation (pyenv) and a great IDE (VSCode)\n* Core computation: polars feels much more like dplyr than pandas\n* The communication stack: seaborn's object interface explicitly inspired by ggplot2, Rich Iaonne's new gt python port\n* Quarto notebooks\n\nThink about it as opinionated data science stack that will feel more familiar to R users!\n\nWHO is this for?\n\n* If you are new to R, and want to come learn about some awesome Python packages and a great integrative developer environment (IDE)?\n* If you are new to Python, and want to learn tools that feel like R?\n* If you use RStudio, and want to learn about a new IDE?\n\n*If any/all of this is true, this event might be for you!*\n\nAGENDA\n\n* 3:00–3:15pm Who we are \\| Announcements \\| What's next\n* 3:15–4 pm Presentation: Python Rgnonomics\n* 4–4:30pm Networking -- Any more Qs?\n\nDetails on the location:\n\n* The Zoom information will be sent to those who RSVP the week before the event.\n\nFAQ:\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend R-Ladies events?\n\nA: Yes, men are welcome at this event. Our mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community.
