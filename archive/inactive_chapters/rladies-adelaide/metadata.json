  "description": "RLadies Adelaide is run by Maria and Helen, who both use the R coding language at work for data analysis, sorting and visualisation. \n<br>\n<br>\n<p>We organise workshops and talks to give you an insight into the many ways that people use R, and to get you started with R too. It doesn't matter whether you are a beginner or an experienced R coder, come and join us!<br><\/p>\n<p>RLadies Adelaide is part of the international organisation RLadies, and aims to encourage more women to get involved in their local programming communities. We encourage all genders to attend our events, and aim always to create a welcoming environment. All talks and workshops at RLadies will be presented by women, in order to strengthen the presence of women in the coding community. <br><\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to bring diversity into R community and get more women excited about technology! <br><\/p>\n<p>We hope to see you at our next event!<br><\/p>",
