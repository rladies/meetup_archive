    "description": "We are incredibly excited to now be able to host a May meetup! Come and spend an evening with R-Ladies of Adelaide at Microsoft Innovation Center on 25th of May.\n\nWe have two topics to present to you this time, led by two awesome women. If you're confused by all the industry/academia buzz around Data Science & R and just want some clarity, this event is for you! R-Ladies Adelaide will give you networking opportunities and provide you examples of career experiences involving R use.\n\nTwo topics in this session:\n\n1) Helen Dockrell \"Using R in the Development of Gut Simulations\"\n\nHelen is a PhD candidate at Centre for Neuroscience Flinders University working on software to simulate gut tissue. Her background is in Biochemistry and Genetics: after working in labs as a researcher she decided to learn to code in C++ at a university short course. She has taught herself R and a number of other languages since then, which she uses to bring complex laboratory data sets together.\n\n2) TBA\n\nTimings: doors open 5 pm, talk starts 5.15 pm\n\nFormat: talk only, no laptops needed\n\nP.S: Please RSVP if you plan on attending so we have an idea of how many to expect.\n\nSee you all soon! Feel free to post on the discussion board if you have any questions or email to adelaide[at]rladies.org.",
