Join us for this holiday edition of R Ladies: Ugly Holiday Plot Contest!\n\nThis extRa special Meetup is a chance for you to let your holiday enthusiasm loose and share with us your ugliest holiday-themed plots. We will also be at a special location: North Boulder Upslope Brewing Company!\n\n*****Please submit your ugly holiday plots to boulder@rladies.org by December 9th to be included in the ugly plot contest!***** Those without ugly plot submissions are also welcome to attend! All are encouraged to wear ugly holiday attire. For inspiration: reddit.com/r/DataIsUgly/.\n\nDuring the meeting we will be showing off all of the lovely ugly plot submissions with the option for submitters to say a few words about their plots if they want! Winners will be selected by categories (think: \"most likely to make somebody lose their eyesight\" or \"most variables plotted at once\").\n\nRefreshments graciously provided by SomaLogic.\n\nCan't wait to see you all there!",

    "description": "This month's guest speaker Amanda Koepke will present on random effects modeling in RStan:\n\nA common problem in science, medicine, and other fields is the need to combine independent measurements (taken over multiple days, or at different labs, or using different measurement methods) into a consensus estimate in a way that recognizes explicitly the contributions that different sources of uncertainty (i.e., within-study uncertainties and between-study differences) make to the overall uncertainty. Many methods exist for this, and past studies have compared the performance of different estimation approaches, however little attention has been paid to Bayesian approaches. In this talk, I will briefly describe my work extending these estimator comparisons to Bayesian models and exploring which approaches are best for common data scenarios at NIST (https://www.nist.gov/). I will then give a short tutorial on how to implement this type of Bayesian analysis in R using RStan. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo used in RStan provides a very efficient way to explore the posterior distribution and allows for the most natural definition of specialized probability distributions. However, it can be tricky to consistently obtain valid samples when trying to fit many simulated datasets with realistic simulation settings. I'll describe some of the issues I encountered and how to deal with some common RStan warnings.",

I'll walk through some common (and some lesser known) data sets published by the federal government as well as some state and local data sources.\n\n**About the Speaker:**\nI have been doing data science-y things including analysis, visualization and some machine learning for about 8 years. I currently do that for the Office of Federal Student Aid in the US Department of Education. My past lives include leading a data team in a small newsroom (hence the knowledge of public data sets) and analyzing, predicting and communicating the health of the World Bank portfolio of projects.",

    "description": "**SPEAKER:** This online event will be lead by Zane Dax ([https://twitter.com/StarTrek_Lt](https://twitter.com/StarTrek_Lt))! Zane has a BHsci in Public Health, started programming in Python but turned avid R user, and is very active on Twitter. She/They make R hexagon logos for R packages and streams on Twitch for data analysis and data visualizations.\n**TOPIC OVERVIEW:** Twitter is a powerful tool and is part of a plethora of social media platforms. Twitter is widely used in the world for data science and research, as well as communication of various data science topics. Being a user is fine, but each tweet captures a lot of data that the user is unaware of - to unlock this hidden information one usually needs to have a Twitter API key to grab all the meta data on every tweet and Twitter user. In this special event, Zane will explain and walk through the rtweet package documentation ([https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf)). She/They will provide explained and ready to go examples with the data ready for your own data analysis, such as text analysis from word counts from tweets collected. This is the only Twitter API tutorial that you get to fully enjoy and learn from without any worry about being granted a API key for your data analysis!PREPARATION AND\n**RESOURCES:** There is nothing to prepare in advance. The tutorial resources are available on GitHub: [https://github.com/PythonCoderUnicorn/rtweet-tutorial](https://github.com/PythonCoderUnicorn/rtweet-tutorial)",

    "title": "RLadies #22: Frequentist & Bayesian Random Effects Models in R: RStan Tutorial",
    "description": "This month's guest speaker Amanda Koepke will present on random effects modeling in RStan:\n\nA common problem in science, medicine, and other fields is the need to combine independent measurements (taken over multiple days, or at different labs, or using different measurement methods) into a consensus estimate in a way that recognizes explicitly the contributions that different sources of uncertainty (i.e., within-study uncertainties and between-study differences) make to the overall uncertainty. Many methods exist for this, and past studies have compared the performance of different estimation approaches, however little attention has been paid to Bayesian approaches. In this talk, I will briefly describe my work extending these estimator comparisons to Bayesian models and exploring which approaches are best for common data scenarios at NIST (https://www.nist.gov/). I will then give a short tutorial on how to implement this type of Bayesian analysis in R using RStan. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo used in RStan provides a very efficient way to explore the posterior distribution and allows for the most natural definition of specialized probability distributions. However, it can be tricky to consistently obtain valid samples when trying to fit many simulated datasets with realistic simulation settings. I'll describe some of the issues I encountered and how to deal with some common RStan warnings.",

These collaborations can be frustrating for both the analyst and non-analyst, with the analyst needing to make and remake tables or visuals and the non-analyst lacking the autonomy to tweak or explore data themselves. One open access and open source based solution is to develop workflows between R and more accessible programs such as Excel or Google Sheets. The googlesheets4 package provides analysts a linking tool so they can leverage the power of R for data processing and visualization while empowering non-analysts with a user-friendly environment for collaboration.\"\n\nZoom link for remote attendees: https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85471235979?pwd=a3FBRWpubysxcDYzS1FvZlhEWVlHZz09",
