This event will be led by a guest, Dr. Suthira Owlarn, coming all the way from the MPI for Molecular Biology in Muenster. Suthira will be teaching us how to use R Shiny, a way to build interactive web applications using R.\n\nShiny is a popular framework for building R-powered interactive web apps and dashboards – and a great way to present your data/analyses to the world! Its ease-of-use makes it beginner-friendly, while its flexibility and extendibility allow more advanced programmers to make use of various skills (e.g. javascript, test-writing).\n\nBased on the initial R Ladies Nijmegen survey, the current plan for the workshop assumes fundamental R skills, but no previous shiny experience. It’ll be a presentation with short exercises, followed by a longer hands-on session and Q&A.\n\nYou can find a more general R concepts refresher to make sure you’re ready for the workshop here: https://github.com/sowla/2019-shiny-intro-workshop-Nijmegen-RLadies\n\nAbout the speaker: Suthira Owlarn is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Münster. After finishing her PhD, she decided to learn a little R and immediately fell in love! Soon, she waved goodbye to the bench and is now having fun diving into the world of data analysis, exploring R packages and building shiny apps.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nDon't forget to bring your (fully charged!) laptop with R Studio installed and with the 'shiny' package.\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nPlease take a minute to read our code of conduct -- we are committed to creating a safe and harassment-free environment\nhttps://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\n\nR-Ladies events are always free and open to anyone who wants to participate as long as they follow the code of conduct.

She is currently working as a postdoc at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology where she studies genetic interactions in childhood tumors. Josephine has programmed in many languages but the last years mainly in R. She knows that there is a lot to learn and working through the first chapters of the Advanced R book has already answered many questions she had about R's peculiarities.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n----------------------\nMake sure to read the chapter in advance!\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT\n----------------------------\nWe expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.
