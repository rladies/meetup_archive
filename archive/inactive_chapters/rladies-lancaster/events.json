In this talk, I will discuss why I was originally hesitant to contribute to open source, but how the R community made me realise my doubts were unfounded. I'll walk you through the stages of making a pull request to a tidyverse package and discuss my experiences of doing so. Whilst the focus of this talk is on contributing code, I conclude with the other valuable ways you can get involved, whether you've been using R for 2 weeks or 20 years. I'd love to make this talk interactive, so please bring any questions you have!\n\nRhian Davies (Jumping Rivers): A day in the life with R.\nI've been using R for many years and at the moment it feels like I basically run my life in the medium of R. I'll give an whirlwind tour of a day in my life as an analyst and all the weird and wonderful ways R helps - and hinders.\n\nLucy Morgan (Lancaster University): The rocky road to building my first R package\nI heard that putting an R package together was simple once you had functions that worked. I must have heard wrong. In this talk I’ll discuss a few of the difficulties I had in starting to build my first R package (you can then avoid these). I’ll also add a few tips from the package building process and demonstrate building a very simple package in R.\n\n*** Venue ***\n\nWe're meeting in Room A076 of the Science & Technology building.
