    "description": "We have quite a few members of this group who are excited to begin their journey in coding with R. There are others in the group who have been using R for a few years and want to advance their skills. Whatever your skill level we would like to invite you to virtually join us on October 13th to go on a Journey Through R! We will kick off this session with information on how to get started with R, along with some beginner level code lines to acclimate you to the language. We will then transition into more advanced R capabilities so you can see all that is possible in the world of R!\n\nWe are hosting this session virtually in order to keep everyone healthy and safe, and to accommodate those needing to participate remotely. Our goal is to create a network of R users so those new to R can find a more advanced mentor, as well as just develop a group any member can turn to for R advice/support.\n\nMeeting Details:\nhttps://miamioh.zoom.us/j/85966026510?pwd=NndMRUZaOFVUeTNzc2hUWnVWalBJZz09\n\nWe will reach out to all registered attendees with the meeting ID and passcode.",
