  "description": "<p><span>R-Ladies Nashville is part of a worldwide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community. We aspire to encourage and support minority genders in Nashville interested in learning or sharing their knowledge of R. For more information, contact us at nashville@rladies.org.<\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>R-Ladies Nashville seeks to create a space where minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) are empowered to teach and are comfortable with asking questions. We welcome all those who will help us toward that goal. Those identifying with minority genders can be leaders, mentors, and members/attendees; others are welcome to attend as guests of a member (+1 on RSVP). The R-Ladies Global Code of Conduct can be found <\/span><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\">here<\/a>, and full mission statement can be found <a href=\"https://rladies.org/about-us/\">here<\/a><span>.<\/span><br><\/p>\n<p><span>Follow us on Twitter <\/span><a href=\"http://twitter.com/RLadiesNash\">@RLadiesNash<\/a><span> and <\/span><a href=\"http://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal\">@RLadiesGlobal<\/a>.
