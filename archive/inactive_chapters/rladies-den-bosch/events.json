    "description": "We are excited to invite you to our first event of 2020!\nDuring this event, Martine Jansen will give a workshop on R Markdown. R Markdown provides a way to integrate code and report content into high quality documents. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats. In this workshop we will create an R Markdown document, in which we use the tidyverse to read a csv and manipulate it. After adding some analyses and plots, we will write inline R code, so the text in the report changes depending on the data. We present the resulting analysis with one click in a nicely formatted Word document. After this workshop you will have the tools to start your own analysis projects with RStudio.\n\nMartine Jansen works for Fontys University of Applied Sciences as an institutional researcher. Another form of this workshop was presented at the EAIR forum 2019 in Leiden and at R-Ladies Amsterdam.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGED DATE**\n\nDate: Tuesday, February 18th, 2020\nStarting time: 6PM\nLocation: Avans Hogeschool Den Bosch (walking distance from train station)\n\nAs a local R-Ladies chapter, we want to host accessible workshops and create a community of R-enthusiasts where everyone can develop their R skills. Everyone who is interested in the R language and supports inclusion in the community is welcome to join.\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nPlease take a minute to read our code of conduct -- we are committed to creating a safe and harassment-free environment\nhttps://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\n\nLooking forward to meeting all of you!\n-- Organizing team R-Ladies Den Bosch",

    "title": "Boook club “Hands-On Machine Learning with R” - Chp11 Random Forests",
    "description": "Join us for our new online boookclub session discussing **‘Hands-On Machine Learning with R**’ by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell! On Monday December 5, we will talk about Chapter 11 - Random Forests.\n\nWe learned about decision trees in the previous session. But why settle for one decision tree when you can have a whole forest of them? :D Random forests are a modification of bagging. They have more predictive power than single decision trees and suffer less from tree correlation than bagging.\n\nOur presenter is **Oussama Zidi**, a biostatistician and project manager at Urgo corporation (a wound healing specialist). He primarily uses SAS and R for stats and machine learning; and python for building apps. He has a graduate degree in applied mathematics from the University of Burgundy, France.\n\n**This boook club:**\nFor this boook club we - the Den Bosch and Utrecht chapters of R Ladies - are joining forces. We will alternate hosting the meetups. In +- 10 meetings (probably more :) ) , we will work through all the chapters in the book together. We are doing this boookclub, because we like to learn together. It is not the case presenters are the experts on the matter. To make this a group effort, the idea is that all participants take turns in presenting chapters, as for example Marianna presented chapter 6, and Elena chapter 7 and 8! We are of course available to help. If you’re not comfortable presenting, just listening is also okay.\nIf you cannot make it this time, feel free to join in on one of the subsequent meetings.\n\n**For who:**\n\n* People who want to take their first steps into machine learning\n* Some prior knowledge on R programming will be helpful. As the authors of the book themselves mention: “This book is not meant to be an introduction to R or to programming in general; as we assume the reader has familiarity with the R language to include defining functions, managing R objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks.”\n\n**What to expect:**\n\n* Presentations summarising the key points on each topic of the book\n* Putting the theory to practice by going through exercises together\n* Room to discuss questions and other thoughts\n\n**Whereabouts**:\n\n* Meet every 2 weeks via Zoom. The password will be sent to you via e-mail before the meeting.\n* We meet every second Monday, from 7 - 8.30 pm\n* It is not necessary to read the chapters in advance, but feel free to do so.\n\nR-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. See the [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/).\nThe book can be found at [https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/). It is also available in print. For the slides of our previous meetings, see [https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club_handsonML](https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club_handsonML).",

    "description": "Join us for the FIFTH meetup for the online boookclub discussing **‘Hands-On Machine Learning with R**’ by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell. On Monday November 7, we discuss Chapter 7 Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Chapter 8 K-Nearest Neighbors.\n\nMultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is an algorithm that automatically creates a piecewise linear model. The KNN algorithm identifies the k observations most similar to a new value and then uses the average response value (regression) or the most common class (classification) of those k observations as the predicted output for the new value.\n\nThese topics will be presented by Elena Dudukina, from the R-Ladies community :). Elena is a clinical specialist and a PhD candidate (awaiting defense) at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital. She is interested in pharmacoepidemiology, especially drug utilization and safety in pregnancy, women’s health and she is also passionate about causal inference methods and R.\n\n**This boook club:**\nFor this boook club we - the Den Bosch and Utrecht chapters of R Ladies - are joining forces.

Monday February 20, we will talk about stacked models.\n\nFrom the book:\n***Stacking*** involves training a new learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several base learners. First, the base learners are trained using the available training data, then a combiner or meta algorithm, called the *super learner*, is trained to make a final prediction based on the predictions of the base learners.\n\nThis chapter will be presented by one of our community members: Ece. Ece Ozler, is from Turkey. She has a graduate degree in Economics from the Koc University in Turkey and a master's in Finance from the Netherlands. She has lived in the Netherlands for almost six years now. She works for an analytics company, FI Analytics, in the banking sector.

In the first session of the new year, on Monday January 9, we will learn all about deep learning with neural networks!\n\nMost machine learning models are shallow models: they only use a few layers of data transformations to reach the output representation. In contrast, **deep learning** uses many layers, where every additional layer creates a more elaborate representation. This results in complex models, for example used in image classification, speech recognition and autonomous driving.\n\nOur presenter is **Galin Bajlekov**: a big fan of neural networks, long-time R user and R-Ladies supporter.
