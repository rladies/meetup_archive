  "description": "R-Ladies Den Bosch welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!\n\n\n\n\nR-Ladies Den Bosch is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global. We aim to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.\nWe are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!\n\n\n\n\n**R-Ladies Den Bosch links**\n\\- Github: [https://github.com/RLadiesDenBosch](https://github.com/RLadiesDenBosch)\n\n\n\n\n**R-Ladies global links**\n- Website: [https://www.rladies.org](https://www.rladies.org)\n\\- Twitter: @RLadiesGlobal \\( [https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal) ) - Github: [https://github.com/rladies](https://github.com/rladies)\n\n\n\n\nPS Community Policies & Code of Conduct:\nThe leadership, mentoring & teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Den Bosch is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.\nFull community guidelines are found here: [https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki)\nPPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings:\nPhotos, Films, and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Den Bosch event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
