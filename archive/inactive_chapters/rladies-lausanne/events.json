    "description": "• Title of talk •\nCreating reproducible analyses and reports with R Markdown\n\n• Speaker •\nClaudia Kasper (https://twitter.com/claudia_kasper)\n\n• Requirements •\n+ A laptop with R and RStudio installed.\n+ R-package RMarkdown (install.packages('rmarkdown’)) and ggplot2 (install.packages(‘ggplot2’) installed.\n+ This is a beginner course. Having used basic commands in R before is sufficient, but no knowledge of markdown, latex or anything similar is required.\n\nThere will be internet access provided by the host.\n\n• Who is Claudia Kasper •\nI am an animal geneticist currently working as a researcher at Agroscope in Posieux, FR, where I work on breeding sustainable pigs. I started my career as an evolutionary biologist, first working on primates, then switching to humans and finally fish and house mice. In all of those systems I was interested in finding out more about cooperation, the social structure enabling it and the genetic basis of this fascinating biological phenomenon. My research is strongly centred on statistics for which I am using R. Having used Mathematica in the beginning, I was missing a neat way to organise my R scripts and to make reports of my findings. After a lot of frustration and literally days of copy-pasting R output into Word documents I discovered RMarkdown a few years ago and I have been using it ever since. Apart from having neater scripts, I ‘knit’ reports of my results as Word or PDF documents, but also presentations and I am trying to do a webpage with RMarkdown. In my free time I play improvisational theatre in Bern in a group which I co-founded.",

This event is hosted at University of Lausanne!\nSpace is limited so please make sure you RSVP to get your spot.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6:00-6:15 pm - Arriving (from the metro stop Chamberonne, follow the purple arrows)\n\n6:15 pm: Introduction to R-Ladies; a presentation with a discussion on:\n• What is R-Ladies?\n• Why did we start R-Ladies Lausanne?\n• What is your role, and how can you get involved in R-Ladies.\n• Brief introductions of the organisers\n\n6:45 pm - A 5 min lightning talk (*) about \"How to arrange graphics from ggplot2 on multipage pdfs\" by Leonore Wigger.\n\nFrom 7 pm onwards we will have an apero with drinks and some food. * Lightning talks - this is an opportunity to informally introduce ourselves and share what we are using R for or what we are hoping to do with R (~ 5-10 minutes each). If you would like to give a little talk, here's a link to sign up HERE (https://goo.gl/forms/l2TEjOD7rTGem0jw1).There is no need for fancy slides (or any slides), the idea is to share our R interests/backgrounds and for the members to get to know each other.",

    "description": "• Title of the talk •\nUsing R to assess Eye-tracking data when investigating Psychological Processes\n\n• Speaker •\nSuzannah Stuijfzand ( https://twitter.com/stuijfzandsooz )\n\n• Schedule •\n18h00 Arrival\n18h15 Presentation\n19h30 - 20h30 Apéro + networking\n\n• Who is Suzannah Stuijfzand •\nI am a research psychologist currently working as a post doc within the Lausanne Perinatal Research group led by Prof. Antje Horsch. The group investigates perinatal mental health, specifically we investigate the impact of stress and trauma in the perinatal period (the time before, during and after birth) on mothers and their families.\nMy background is firmly routine in developmental psychology. My research masters in development and socialization in childhood and adolescence and my PhD was on Cognitive processes and their association to Anxiety in young children. My career so far has led me from the UK to the Netherlands for my masters, back to the UK for my PhD and finally my post-doc has brought me here to Lausanne.\nMy research has necessitated an interest in diverse methodologies in an attempt to overcome the limitations in standard measures (i.e. reaction times) when studying children. I have also has to become accustomed to longitudinal data in order to study development. It is through these elements of my research that have brought me into contact with R in an attempt to make the best use of my data to answer my research questions.",
