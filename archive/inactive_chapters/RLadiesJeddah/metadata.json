We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools.\nR-Ladies welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!\nWe are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities.
