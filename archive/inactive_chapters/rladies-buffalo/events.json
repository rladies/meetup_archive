    "description": "This will be a very informal event. This initial meet up is meant to meet each other and find out a little bit about where everyone envisions this group going. We want to know how much background you have in R and what topics are of interest. We chose Spot Coffee on Hertel right now but based on who comes we can chose a more central location for future events. We will also be curious as to what days/times work best for everyone to try and meet the needs of the group for scheduling other events.",
