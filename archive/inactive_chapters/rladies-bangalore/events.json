    "description": "We are happy to announce that we will be kick starting R-Ladies Bangalore chapter on 12 September 2020 @ 3:30 pm IST. This event will involve talks and interactive session from the R-Ladies Bangalore organisers, mentors!\n\nWe believe in R-Ladies Global organisation's vision-\n\nOur priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R. We promote diversity. There is no cost to participate in any of the R-Ladies Meetup. Our goal is to exchange knowledge and experiences of R programming in a supportive environment. We also aim to produce more R speakers using this platform.\n\nPlease make sure you read and comply with our code of conduct ( https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct ) and community guidelines ( https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/master/RLadiesRulesAndGuideLinesENES.md ).\n\nWe are happy to announce that we will be having the first R-Ladies Meetup along with the kick start! 🎉\n\nRegister yourself by filling up this form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScb8cb5wTfMx_4GlELJzkaYtKIG-PvMzOL2twWwqFGOUVFBUQ/viewform).\n\nAbout the meet-up: This Meetup will be focused for beginners in R. It will include: using basic R Commands and importing/exporting a dataset. It will also help in understanding data structures, manipulating the data and visualizing it. A follow up exercise is included.\n\nAbout the instructor: Anupama got her PhD from the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore in March 2020. She is currently employed at Sabre Travel Technologies in Bangalore and makes market share predictions for airlines. Her interests lie in business forecasting and time series analysis. She uses R primarily for her work but is slowly making forays into PySpark and TensorFlow. She also happens to be one of the co-organiser of the R-Ladies Bangalore chapter.\n\n📣\nImportant instructions:\n\n1. If you are a beginner and have never used R, we would recommend you to download the stable version of R for Windows (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/) or for mac/Linux (https://mirror.niser.ac.in/cran/). It will be a hands-on session. If you do not have access to a system you can use the limited free cloud service provided by RStudio (https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free).\n\n2. Also, for a smooth experience with R it is best to work with RStudio, an IDE which can be downloaded (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).\nHere is a guide to install R and RStudio (https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/).\n\n3. If you are unable to install it in your system, you can join 15 minutes prior to the Meetup, the co-organisers can help you to set up.\n\n4. We will share the link of the slides after the Meetup.\n\nWe are on twitter, find us at: R-Ladies BLR (https://twitter.com/RLadiesBLR) and keep a lookout here to get updates about upcoming events here.\n\nYou can find more information about R here (https://www.r-project.org/).\nYou can find more information about R - Ladies Global (https://rladies.org/).\nPlease feel free to reach out to us with your queries/suggestions and spread the word at bangalore@rladies.org. The zoom link will be shared to those who have registered for the event using the form above.\nAll events this year will be online.\n\nCheers,\nR-Ladies Bangalore Team",

    "description": "About the instructor:\nDr. Cédric Scherer is a graduated computational ecologist with a passion for design. In 2020, he combined his expertise in analyzing and visualizing large data sets in R with his passion to become an freelance data visualization specialist. Cédric has created visualizations across all disciplines, purposes, and styles and regularly teaches data visualization principles, R, and ggplot2. Due to regular participation in social data challenges, he is now well known for complex and visually appealing figures, entirely made with ggplot2, that look as if they have been created with a vector design tool.\n\nAbstract\nThe #30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping challenge happening during November aimed at the spatial data visualization community. In this seminar, Cédric Scherer gives insights in his learnings from his two participations in the first and third #30DayMapChallenge in 2019 and 2021, discussing the benefits and limitations of crafting maps in R with ggplot2 as well as learnings with regard to spatial data sources, spatial data handling in R and map design.",

    "title": "Creating R Markdown Template for Reproducible Research",
    "description": "In this session, he will discuss how to create R Markdown templates for reproducible repetitive research work in R. This session will be half presentation, and half hands-on work so that you get acquainted with the workflow of creating an R Markdown template. This will require you to have R, RStudio (preferably version 1.4 or the recent daily build), along with packages “usethis” and “tinytex” installed on your computer. The “usethis” package makes creating such templates very easy and smooth. On the other hand, “tinytex” package will be required only if your desired output format is PDF. If your desired output format is HTML or a Word Document, you will not need tinytex.\n\nAbout the instructor:\nMaulik Bhatt is a work-from-home parent with 16 years of experience in industry and academics. One of his colleagues introduced him to R in 2017. After this quick introductory session, he started learning R on his own. He was a doctoral candidate at Mumbai’s S P Jain Institute of Management & Research in 2018 when he had to take a career break due to his health. Despite this, he continued learning R on his own. He uses R Markdown for most of his work, relying less on word processor software. He aspires to complete his doctoral study from next year onwards.",

    "description": "About the instructor:\nRahul Venugopal is a fourth-year Ph.D. scholar at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, India. His research revolves around understanding: how we experience the world as it is, how to improve intelligence/memory, and similar questions. He relies on many statistical & signal processing tools to make sense out of the brain. He has worked in multiple research projects involving topics like brain-computer interface, meditation, sleep, cognition, well-being, etc.\n\nAbstract:\nI am a consciousness researcher exploring various puzzles involving human minds, intelligence, and consciousness. This is an experiential talk looking back at my journey through the R verse. For my Ph.D. research work I had to model some complicated functions which were not available in conventional GUI based and one of my seniors in the lab suggested R. There it began. This talk is a reflection on challenges I faced in the process of learning R, all the things I wish I knew at multiple time points in the journey and type of mentors, I wish I dodged.",
