    "description": "We are pleased to invite you to our next meetup which will serve as an overview of the R Package ‘ggstatsplot’: ‘ggplot2’ Based Plots with Statistical Details.\n\n\"ggstatsplot\" is an extension of \"ggplot2\". It creates graphics with details from statistical tests included in the plots themselves. It is targeted primarily at behavioral sciences community to provide a one-line code to generate information-rich plots for statistical analysis of continuous (violin plots, scatterplots, histograms, dot plots, dot-and-whisker plots) or categorical (pie and bar charts) data. Currently, it supports only the most common types of statistical tests: parametric, nonparametric, robust, and bayesian versions of t-test/anova, correlation analyses, contingency table analysis, and regression analyses.\n\nThis wonderful R package is created by Indrajeet Patil. Come & join us to learn more about it https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/ggstatsplot\n\n▶️ About Indrajeet Patil https://sites.google.com/site/indrajeetspatilmorality/\nIndrajeet Patil is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Center for Humans and Machines, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin.

We will be organizing a new meetup about Cédric'favorite ggplot2 extension Packages.\n\nDate/Time: Wednesday, July, 8th 2021 from 6 PM to 7 PM (GMT+1)\nPlace: Zoom\n\n▶️ Invited trainer: Cédric Scherer\n\n▶️ About Cédric Scherer :\n\nCédric is a trained researcher in ecology, evolution and nature conservation with a focus on computational biology. After his PhD, he combined his expertise in analysing and visualizing large data sets in R with his passion for design to create visualizations across all disciplines, purposes, and styles to become a freelance data visualization specialist. In his spare time, Cédric is contributing regularly to the #TidyTuesday challenge and other data visualization contests and is hosting the #30DayChartChallenge together with Dominic Royé that took place for the first time this year.\n\n▶️ About the workshop:\n\nAbstract: ggplot2 is a graphics library for R which comes with many geometries that allow you to build numerous and highly customized data visualizations. In this talk, I am going to present the most exciting extension packages to create various chart types within the ggplot2 framework but that are not part of the ggplot2 package itself. We are going to cover popular chart types such as bump graphs and ridgeline plots but also less common variants, for example stream graphs, moon plots, and geofacets.\n\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉\nhttps://tinyurl.com/ypu3wt79\n\nWe will send you the zoom link a few hours before the training session.

We will be organizing a new workshop about Using Github for collaboration.\n\nDate/Time: Thursday, June 10th, 2021 from 6 PM to 8 PM (GMT+1)\nPlace: Zoom\n\n▶️ Invited trainer: Dr. Lisa Lendway\n\n▶️ About Dr. Lisa Lendway :\nDr. Lisa Lendway teaches statistics and data science at Macalester College, a small liberal arts college for undergraduates in St. Paul, MN USA. She is passionate about applying statistics to any subject matter and enjoys helping people see the benefits of using statistical analysis and data visualization to answer questions. Outside of statistics, Lisa enjoys spending time with her two daughters, cycling with her husband, making old things new, and playing in her jungle garden. She even went so far as to record her harvest data last year and turn it into an R package: https://github.com/llendway/gardenR\n\n▶️ About the workshop:\nIn this MeetUp, we'll talk about using Git and GitHub with R projects in the RStudio IDE. This will be a hands-on talk with plenty of opportunity to interact. To get the most out of the meeting, it is recommended that you do a few steps before the meeting: see the \"What you should already know\" section of my https://lisalendway.netlify.app/posts/2021-02-24-gitinrstudio/ blog post to get your GitHub account set up and to connect it with RStudio. First, we will review how to create our own projects and practice committing, pushing, and creating branches. Then, we will practice adding collaborators where we will clone a repo and deal with a merge conflict. Next, we'll talk about pull requests and practice doing them! Lastly, I'll talk about a couple ways you can undo things you didn't mean to do in Git. I am by no means a Git or GitHub pro. So along the way, I'll probably make some mistakes, but there's no better way to learn, right?\n\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉\nhttps://tinyurl.com/2k88f8nd\n\nWe will send you the zoom link a few hours before the training session.

    "description": "We are delighted to get back to the R4Bioinfo series that we've launched in September 2020. We will be organizing a new workshop which will serve as a Tidy Transcriptomics introduction to bulk and scRNA sequencing analyses.\n\nDate/Time: Saturday, April 9, 2021 from 10 AM to 12:15 PM (GMT+1)\nPlace: Zoom https://zoom.us/download\n\n▶️ Invited trainers: Dr. Stefano Mangiola and Dr. Maria Doyle\n\n▶️ About Dr. Stefano Mangiola:\nDr. Stefano Mangiola is currently a Postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Prof. Tony Papenfuss. His background spans from biotechnology to bioinformatics and biostatistics. His research focuses on prostate and breast tumour microenvironment, the development of statistical model for the analysis of RNA sequencing data, and data analysis and visualisation interfaces.\n\n▶️ About Dr. Maria Doyle:\nDr. Maria Doyle is the Application and Training Specialist for Research Computing at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She has a PhD in Molecular Biology and currently works in bioinformatics and data science education and training. She is passionate about supporting researchers, reproducible research, open source and tidy data.\n\n▶️ About the workshop:\n\nThis workshop will present how to perform analysis of RNA sequencing data following the tidy data paradigm (Wickham and others 2014). The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions.\nThis can be achieved for RNA sequencing data with the tidybulk, tidyHeatmap (Mangiola and Papenfuss 2020) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) packages. The tidybulk package provides a tidy data structure and a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses. tidyHeatmap provides a tidy implementation of ComplexHeatmap. These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. The last section of the workshop will be focused on the analysis of single cell data in a tidy fashion with the packages tidySCE and tidyseurat.\n\nThe topics presented in this workshop will be:\n\n▪️ Data exploration\n▪️ Data dimensionality reduction and clustering\n▪️ Differential gene expression analysis\n▪️ Data visualisation\n\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos\n\nWe will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

She has experience designing, implementing, and maintaining data collection, management, and curation tools on a variety of projects ranging from large national cohort studies to RCTs in topics related to COVID-19, microbiome, HIV, substance use, and mental health. Her own research interests are focused on the role of the microbiome on human health, causal inference in microbiome research, and improving the epidemiological rigor of health and bioinformatics research.\nChloe's dissertation research will focus on the impact of antibiotics on the human gut microbiome. Her mentor and dissertation committee chair is CUNY ISPH Investigator Dr. Levi Waldron.\n\n➡️ About the workshop:\nConcepts of causal inference in epidemiology have important ramifications for studies across bioinformatics and other fields of health research. In this workshop, Chloe Mirzayi will introduce basic concepts of epidemiology, study design, and causal inference for bioinformaticians. Emphasis is placed on addressing bias and confounding as common threats to assessing a causal pathway in a variety of study design types and when using common forms of analyses such as GWAS and survival analysis. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to create their own structural causal models (DAGs) and use this model to determine how to assess an estimated causal effect. Examples using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma will be used to show how multivariable models can be fitted depending on the hypothesized causal relationship.\n\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 https://tinyurl.com/bpdshsj4\n\nWe will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

    "description": "We are delighted to get back to the R4Bioinfo series that we've launched in September 2020. We will be organizing a new workshop which will serve as an overview of the integrating gene expression and DNA-binding data using R/Bioconductor.\n\nDate/Time : Saturday, February 27, 2021 from 2 PM to 4:15 PM (GMT+1)\nPlace : Zoom https://zoom.us/download\n\n▶️ Invited trainer : Dr. Mahmoud Shaaban\n▶️ About Dr. Mahmoud Shaaban :\nDr. Mahmoud Shaaban graduated from medical school, Cairo University, Egypt, in 2015. He received his master's and PhD from Gyeongsang National University, Korea, in 2021, where he studied the role of autophagy in development and disease. He used R/Bioconductor to analyze gene expression and transcription data from mice models. He wrote open-source R packages to distribute the data, methods, and code of my research\n\nDescription of the workshop :\nResearchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. They use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the factor over-expression or knockdown on its targets. The integration of the binding and expression data therefore can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. In this workshop, I present a complete workflow for integrating the gene expression (microarray/RNA-seq) and DNA-binding data (ChIP-seq) to predict the combined function of two transcription factors using R/Bioconductor. The example we will be using in the workshop is from real datasets of two functionally and evolutionary related transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells. We will try to identify the factor-specific and the shared targets of the factors in this particular cell line. Then we will use a technique find out the aggregate functions of the factors on their individual (inducer or repressor) and common targets (cooperative or competitive).\n\nMore details about the workshop are provided through this link https://mahshaaban.github.io/IntegratingDataBioc/\n\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 https://tinyurl.com/y7kzasq7\n\nWe will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

Right now, she is working full-time for Data4Good network CorrelAid for which she has been volunteering since its beginnings in 2015. There, she is responsible for the coordination of the skilled-volunteering data science projects which are at the core of CorrelAid’s work. In addition, she organizes educational events and workshops.\nFrie has a background in social science but transitioned to data science after her Bachelor’s degree and worked in IT consulting for two years. She loves to juggle and visualize data in R and likes to automate all kinds of things using her other programming skills.\n\nAbstract :\nOften when collecting data, we want to do so on a recurring basis. But how? Especially when starting out with (R) programming, this can be a complex challenge as sentences like \"just set up a EC2 instance\" are thrown at you without much context. In my talk, I will take you along my personal learning journey over the course of the past 3.5 years and three solution approaches: from a hacky R script on a Raspberry Pi (a mini computer) to a Python-solution in \"the cloud\" back to an improved R/Raspberry Pi version. In the process, I'll cycle back to fundamental tools/concepts like CRON that are central to automation.\n\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 https://tinyurl.com/y4rbgau2\nWe will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the meetup.

    "description": "We are delighted to get back to the R4Bioinfo series that we've launched in September 2020. We will be organizing a workshop which will cover the RNA-seq analysis.\n\nThe ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor (https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408).\n\nDate/Time : Februrary 6th, 2021 from 10:00 AM to 12:15 PM GMT+1\nPlace : Zoom https://zoom.us/download\n\n▶️ Trainer : Xueyi Dong\n▶️ About Xueyi Dong (https://github.com/XueyiDong) :\nXueyi Dong is a PhD candidate at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.

At university he worked with SPSS and Stata. His first contact to R came in 2007, when he worked for a small company that thought about avoiding the SPSS licence fees. After a 2-day-workshop he vowed to never open the R software again. It took seven years to start the next attempt. Since late 2014, Wolf has been working his way into R and never looked back. He now focuses on workshops and trainings, mostly online since 2020 after many in-person-workshops since 2017.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfriepl/\n▶️ About the talk:\nWhat may sound like a very advanced topic is actually much easier than you may think! And it feels really good to have created a package.\nWhat we'll do:\n\\- Create our first package in RStudio in 2 minutes\n\\- Create a package with our own function\\, and document the function to get a regular help page for it\nOutlook and discussion:\n\\- Adding data to a package \\(or creating a pure data package\\) and documenting it\n\\- Adding vignettes to a package: a more general form of documentation compared to the more specific function documentation \\- Setting up automated testing using testthat\nMake sure to join us!\nIn order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉\nhttps://tinyurl.com/5ftbs8xb\nWe will send you the zoom link a few hours before the training session.

Instead of spending most of your time creating your reports, just streamline the process. Let's use R to tackle this problem! Don't worry, if your audience lives and swears by a spreadsheet, you can still use R. In this talk, we will demonstrate a simple and easy way you can use R to automate most of your reports. After implementing these simple techniques, you will be able to spend more time changing the world and less time on reports.

It is planned fundamentally considering information researchers, and keeping that in mind, you can make pretty confounded Shiny applications with no knowledge about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Then again, Shiny doesn’t restrict you to making insignificant or pre-assembled applications: its UI segments can be handily modified or expanded, and its worker utilizes responsive programming to allow you to make any sort of back-end rationale you need. R Shiny is intended to feel mystically simple when you’re beginning, but then the further you get into how it functions, the more you understand it’s worked out of broad structure obstructs that have solid programming standards behind them.\nR Shiny Application is utilized in nearly however many specialties and ventures as R itself is. It’s utilized in scholarly world as a showing device for measurable ideas, an approach to get students camped up for figuring out how to compose code, a sensational mode for flaunting novel factual techniques or models. It’s utilized by huge pharma organizations to speed cooperation among researchers and examiners during drug improvement. It utilizes real-time measurement dashboards that fuse progressed investigation.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you!",
