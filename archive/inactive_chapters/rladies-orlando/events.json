We will be looking at students' SAT , GPA scores and try to draw conclusion on their college success. Dr. Kari l Jordan will be discussing the meta data and what questions to ask when presented with new dataset. • What to bring: Charged laptop with R, Rstudio and Tidyverse package ready to go. You can download the dataset before hand here: https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_orlando.git\n\nSampleStudents.csv\n\nIf you are new to R programming, this will be a good session to see the thought process that goes into data analysis. We will be offering more \"beginner friendly\" tutorials in the future, please stay connected!\n\n• Important to know : As always , everyone is welcome, but must adhere to our code of conduct : https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\n\nTEEPS has graciously offered to host our Meetups and it will be our regular home for the year.
