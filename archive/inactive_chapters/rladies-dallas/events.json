    "description": "• What we'll do\nFinding your bearings in data science can be difficult. Often it feels like you've been dropped in the wilderness and are just trying to survive with the contents of your backpack - and you packed all the wrong things.\n\nOur goal as RLadies Dallas is to start helping members fill their \"data science backpack\" with the skills and content knowledge needed to not only survive as data scientists (who use R), but to thrive as data scientists, no matter the environment.\n\nThis will be a collaborative workshop where we outline the data science workflow and practice moving through the workflow using our own data sets and the tidyverse, with a particular focus on applying statistical models to a data set.\n\nMembers are encouraged to have read through \"OpenIntro Statistics\" up to the point that they feel comfortable. That might be the whole text for some members, or half of chapter one for others. There's no judgement or expectation, we just ask that you do your best!\n\nFor those comfortable with the majority of the contents, you will be expected to take on leadership roles and mentor those still learning, while those learning should come prepared to ask questions. It's entirely possible that you're a mentor for some chapters, and a learner in others, and that's awesome! The goal is for both learners and mentors to develop a deeper understanding of statistical models and how to apply them to data sets that we use in our research, jobs, and/or hobbies.\n\n*** please note *** we will be discussing whether or not the \"OpenIntro Statistics\" text is the text we'd like to use for this meetup in our Slack group. If we choose a different text, this posting will be updated to reflect that.\n\n• What to bring\nA laptop that can connect to the internet\nA data set to work on (if you have one - if not, we will provide examples you can use)\nAny food or drinks for personal consumption\nClothing layers - the temperature in the space can fluctuate\n\n• Important to know\nOpenIntro Statistics is available for free online here: https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=os\n\nIf you need assistance setting up Slack, installing R, installing RStudio or finding a dataset, please email dallas [at] rladies [dot] org and we'll get you squared away!\n\nWe know that not everyone lives close by - please coordinate rideshares in our #rideshares channel in Slack. If you cannot attend in person, email dallas [at] rladies [dot] org so we can set up the technology for you to join us via Zoom.",

Our hosts at Improving have generously provided free pizza and assorted beverages, including coffee/tea, soda, water, and BEER. :)\n\nFeel free to reach out to Sydeaka at at dallas@rladies.org if you have any questions!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbout R-Ladies Dallas\n\nR-Ladies Dallas welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!\n\nA local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Dallas exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend R-Ladies events?\nA: Yes, men are welcome at this event. Our mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. Please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.\n\nWe expect all attendees to abide & be governed by our community code of conduct. Please take a moment to review our R-Ladies Global code of conduct (particularly if this is your first time attending!): https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct.",

Hard skills, like learning to code in R, is something that can be taught. Soft skills are \"people\" or interpersonal skills that are not easily learned and require some practice. This presentation will highlight five soft suit skills that are important for data scientists to learn; especially those wanting to go into consulting. Sample deliverables of data science projects will also be shared.\n\nSpeaker bio:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/katmorgan/\nKat Morgan is a data science consultant with Elicit, an award-winning consultancy that helps clients transform the way they use data to enhance both customer and employee experience.

    "description": "For the December edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Stephanie Kirmer as our guest speaker. She will introduce the topic of Isolation Forests for tree-based anomaly detection.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBranching Out into Isolation Forests: Tree Based Anomaly Detection\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbstract:\nIsolation forests offer a new way to approach unsupervised anomaly detection problems, and in this talk attendees will get an end-to-end tutorial with code and visual explanations on how to apply the technique in R. Among other advantages, isolation forests offer interpretability and rapid runtime, so they are useful in business and production settings.\n\nBio:\nStephanie Kirmer is a Senior Data Scientist at Saturn Cloud, a platform enabling easy to use parallelization and scaling for Python with Dask. (But she still loves R as well.) Previously she worked as a DS Tech Lead at Journera, a travel data startup, and Senior Data Scientist at Uptake, where she developed predictive models for diagnosing and preventing mechanical failure. Before joining Uptake, she worked on data science for social policy research at the University of Chicago and taught sociology and health policy at DePaul University.\n\nSlides/Code:\nStephanie's slides were prepared using the R xaringan package and are available in the following github repository in the 'r' subdirectory. Code used in her demo are also provided in the repo. You are invited to follow along during the presentation. https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests\n\nTwitter: @data_stephanie\n\nWebsite: http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nYou are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community. Slack is a messaging platform where we will share open job opportunities, free or low-cost online training materials, and R-Ladies group projects that will help you practice your R programming skills and develop a portfolio that could be used to showcase your skills to hiring managers.\n\nWebinar + Slack sign-up: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJhvSg-YrNYOrmju1yrXvYhFM7xMey1WpDq1NSGIp6x41VaA/viewform\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nWe expect all attendees to abide & be governed by our community code of conduct.

    "description": "Hi, R-Ladies!\n\nIn our last few events, we resolved to challenge ourselves to grow in our R programming skills. Congratulations to those of you who made it through the lectures and practice problems in the \"Data Analysis with R\" course on Udacity.\n\nLink to the course: https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651\n\nTo help us all get a firmer understanding of the concepts learned in the course, we have decided to work on a class project. In our last event, we voted to create a series of projects around the Loan Default Prosper dataset suggested in the Udacity course in Lesson 10 for the Final Project. Details are provided in this document. The Loan Default Prosper dataset is the second-to-last row in the table.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEcwltBMlRYZT-l699-71TzInWfk4W9q5rTCSvDVMpc/pub\n\nThis type of dataset appears often in data science interview challenges, so it would be helpful to get familiar with the dataset, learn loan/credit terminology, and gain some initution about the unique challenges an analyst will encounter with this type of project. In this meetup, we will get an introduction to this dataset and get a first look at the first mini-project that we will work on together as a group.\n\nWe will also have a chance to briefly discuss the social justice initiatives that Sydeaka Watson discussed in her Why R? webinar talk, \"Data Science for Social Justice Activism\". To attend/register for the Why R? webinar, see the details provided at the following link.\n\nhttps://www.meetup.com/rladies-dallas/events/273060804/\n\n*************************\n\nYou are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!\n\nA local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Dallas exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R.

    "description": "For the June 1st edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Danica Slavish as our guest speaker. Dr. Slavish will introduce the topic of Latent Profile Analyses using the tidyLPA framework.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSession title: Latent Profile Analyses using tidyLPA\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbstract: Do adolescents who try alcohol before age 15 have worse health in adulthood than those who try alcohol later in life? Are there different subtypes of COVID-19 symptoms? How do these subtypes predict hospitalization risk? What types of advertisements most strongly predict if someone buys a product?\n\nAll these questions can be answered using the statistical technique, latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA is a powerful statistical tool to identify hidden clusters in your data based on a set of variables. LPA is superior to other data reduction techniques like k-means clustering in that it generates probabilities of group membership. In this talk, a brief introduction to LPA using the R package tidyLPA will be covered. Using sample data on daily sleep patterns of nurses, we will walk through an example using the current gold standard 3-step approach: 1) estimate class membership, 2) extract class probabilities, 3) examine predictors of class membership. Best practices and advantages and disadvantages of LPA will be discussed.\n\nBio: Dr. Danica Slavish is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of North Texas. Danica’s research focuses on how sleep problems and stressful life experiences interact to predict health outcomes across time. Her research team uses a variety of statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal data in R, including multilevel modeling, time-varying effect modeling, network analyses, and Bayesian analyses. Danica currently teaches courses in health psychology, advanced statistics, and research methods. Before joining UNT, Danica completed her Ph.D. in biobehavioral health at Penn State, where she was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. She holds an undergraduate degree in psychology from Beloit College, in Beloit, WI.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/danicaslavish\n\nWebsite:\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nYou are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

    "title": "\"Flexible reproducibility in data workflows\" with Brooke Watson Madubuonwu",
    "description": "For the May 11th edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Brooke Watson Madubuonwu as our guest speaker. Brooke will discuss \"Flexible reproducibility in data workflows\".\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSession title: Flexible reproducibility in data workflows\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbstract: Sometimes, when data collected for an analysis doesn’t change, the process of tidying is a one-time investment. Other times, raw data changes by the hour or minute, requiring automated systems of extraction, transformation, and loading. But what of the case in the middle? How should analysts and data scientists handle the system changes, the month-over-month tweaks, and data sources that involve a human in the loop?\n\nThis talk will cover strategies and tactics for creating resilient and flexible reproducibility in data workflows. I’ll discuss real-world examples, explore mistakes I've made along the way, and share R packages and functions that help navigate the space between customization and automation.\n\nBio: Brooke Madubuonwu is the Director of Legal Analytics & Quantitative Research at the American Civil Liberties Union, where she & her team use data science & statistics to advance civil rights through advocacy, legislative support, and litigation. Her work ranges from the measurement of racial and gender disparities in housing, education, and criminal justice, to the analysis of gerrymandered voting districts throughout the US. Before joining the ACLU, she trained as an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and studied zoonotic viruses as a research scientist at the NY-based nonprofit, EcoHealth Alliance. She completed her undergraduate studies in biology at the University of Tennessee, and hails from Memphis, TN.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/brookLYNevery1\n\nWebsite:\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nYou are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

    "description": "For the January 25th edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Seo-young Silvia Kim as our guest speaker. Dr. Kim will introduce the topic of reproducible workflows for research. Although the term \"research\" brings thoughts of academic research to mind (for example, a dissertation or thesis), these ideas are also directly applicable to other workflows that professional data scientists and analysts encounter in their daily work. Whatever your role, we hope you will come ready to enhance your understanding and appreciation of reproducible workflows and feel empowered to apply this framework in your research.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSession title: Reproducible Workflow When Writing a Research Paper\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbstract: College and Ph.D. students who do empirical work often underestimate the problems associated with reproducibility. Certain lessons should be shared for those entering the research phase, which will help not to struggle or waste time later. From setting up an R project to using renv, I discuss some of the most important things that new researchers should be mindful of when starting a new data analysis project.\n\nBio: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at American University. I received my Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 2020. My research interests are in American Politics and Political Methodology, focusing on political behavior (registration/turnout/campaign contributions), working with large voter files and Federal Election Commission datasets. I mainly use R and Stan to employ tools such as probabilistic record linkage, semiparametric regressions, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics.\n\nTwitter: @sysilviakim\n\nWebsite: sysilviakim.com\n\n*************************************************************************\n\nYou are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

    "description": "Happy New Year! For the January 18th edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Rachael Tatman as our guest speaker. Dr. Tatman will introduce the topic of data science portfolios. A data science portfolio is a great way to showcase your data science skills to hiring managers and recruiters. If you are on the hunt for your next data science gig (or anticipate that you will be looking soon), I highly encourage you to attend this talk.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSession title: Data Science Portfolios 101\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAbstract: In this talk, Dr. Tatman will share tips and tricks for putting together a data science portfolio to help you get hired. She will also share general information about data careers in tech.\n\nBio: Dr. Rachael Tatman is a senior developer advocate at Rasa, where she helps developers use open source software to build great conversational AI projects.
