    "description": "Have you ever wanted to build an interactive web application without learning CSS, HTML, and JavaScript? If yes, the Shiny package in R is the package for you - it allows you to build interactive dashboards that you can easily share with non-R users and let them explore your datasets and analyses. During our meeting, Gabi will show us how to build a Shiny app that does basic data exploration.\n\n~Agenda~\nIntro (5min)\nPresentation (35min)\nHands-on Practice (30min)\nClosing Comments (10min)\n\n~Notes~\nYou'll find us in the large meeting room in the Plaza library. Free on-site parking is available for library guests. Feel free to bring your laptops to build your own Shiny app during our hands-on session. We look forward to seeing you there!",

    "description": "**Location still needs to be determined. It will likely be downtown KC, the plaza, or in the Mission, KS area**\n\nJoin us for an event about Exploratory Data Analysis in R! We'll also have a post-workshop social where we can chat over coffee near the event location.\n\n***Agenda***\n10:30-10:45 Welcome and Introductions\n10:45-11:45 Workshop by Gabi Cipriano and Anna Pechenina\n11:45-12:00 Q&A and Discussion\n\n***About the Talk***\nFor our first workshop, we start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA, for short). With EDA you can answer questions about your data with visualizations, transformations, and data models. You can then use those outputs to refine and create new questions. This talk will cover how to ask these types of questions at the beginning of your analysis in order to lead to the more interesting and substantive questions about your data.\n\nThe topics we'll cover are the following:\n1. Visualizing variation within and between variables\n2. How to deal with pesky and ever-present missing data\n3. Descriptive statistics and their corresponding visualizations\n4. Intro to string variables manipulation\n\nKey packages we'll use: ggplot2, ~the tidyverse~, plotly, rmarkdown\n\nWe'll wrap up the workshop with an introduction to reporting in R Markdown. You'll see how to convert your code into attractive reports and presentations, and, if time permits, how to create interactive documents using Shiny.\n\n***About the Speakers***\nGabi Cipriano is a data analyst at Cerner, where she transforms and visualizes clinical data from the electronic medical record for a school of public health's research projects. Anna Pechenina is a research analyst for the Department of Human Health and Services as well as a Political Science lecturer. Both have joined forces with Boryana Koseva, a bioinformatician at KU, to found R Ladies' Kansas City chapter.\n\n***Things to Know***\nPlease help spread the word and ask people to follow us on Twitter or Meetup.\n\nFeel free to bring a laptop if you would like to follow along, but it is not required. Code will be shared with attendees!\n\nSnacks will be provided as the workshop is very close to lunch time.\n\nWe expect all attendees to abide by our community code of conduct.
