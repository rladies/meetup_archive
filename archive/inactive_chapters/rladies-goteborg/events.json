    "title": "Data reporting with RMarkdown: from novice to master",
    "description": "This meetup will cover basic features of RMarkdown and a few tricks that may help to create professional analytical reports using data. RMarkdown is a markup language, which enables users to embed R code in the document, edit text and document styles, and render visual information. Documents created using RMarkdown can be exported in a variety of formats, including .docx and .pdf.\n\nKnowledge of RMarkdown allows R users integrate text and data analysis results in one place easier, including data checks, tables, and visualization. Additional benefit of RMarkdown is its ability to present data and analysis in interactive manner but this feature is out of the focus of this meeting.\n\n===\nPassword for Zoom meeting: 486933\n===",

This also means there is no need for you to run the code or write it down in your Rstudio script as we go along.\n\nAs you will learn fast, a lot of the code you will use in R is already written somewhere in the internet. The task for the user is to understand what is happening and learn how to consult the reference guides or how to “google” for answers.\n\nIn this session, we will focus on learning a couple of ggplot2 important concepts and making things pretty without so much effort.\n\nPart II - Other types of graphs\nMaking things pretty: ggthemes, Rcolorbewer and patchwork\n\nRequirements for part II:\nBeing able to create a scatterplot in R on your own using basic and ggplot2\n\nContact us here if you have any questions or comments before or after the event!\n\nFind the event here: https://meet.jit.si/IntroToR",
