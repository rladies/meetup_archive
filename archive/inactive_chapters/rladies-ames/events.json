We will start from the very basics of version control (collaborating with your past self) and work up to the skills necessary to contribute to an existing open source project (collaborating with other people). Effective collaboration and version control are essential for researchers to easily recover from the nasty snafus that we (or our collaborators) can get ourselves into through better file management. So, what are you waiting for? Let's get git-ting!\n\nPre-workshop Homework:\n\nIf you plan on attending this workshop, please do the following two things ahead of time:\n\n• Sign up for GitHub (http://github.com (http://github.com/))\n\n• Install SourceTree client for Git ( https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ )",

Have you always wanted to learn how to make better plots? Maybe you want to learn how to webscrape? Perhaps generalized linear modeling tickles your fancy? We all have that one (or two, or ten...) thing we want to learn how to do in R, so we'll help each other set some SMART R-centered goals to achieve in 2018!\n\n• What to bring\nA computer and something to write with. (Torrent has WiFi.) You can also bring food, since Torrent doesn't serve food.",

Blogdown is a popular R package developed for producing a static website from R Markdown documents. Even if you are currently using GitHub pages for your personal website, you might be interested in this talk after reading this post by Yihui (https://yihui.org/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/).\nIn this talk, we’ll introduce some tips and tricks for building a personal website with Blogdown based on our own experience. This talk is expected to be a hands-on workshop (something fun and meaningful to do during quarantine). Participants would have a chance to build their own “baby” website and deploy the website online with Netlify!\n\nPreparation: It would be helpful if you register a Netlify account and master some basics about GitHub and Markdown in advance. You can be even more prepared and start to work on your own website now by following this tutorial written by Annie (https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/). That’s how Anabelle created her own website (www.anabellelaurent.com)!",
