She is a Statistician & Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai (http://www.h2o.ai/), the company that produces the open source machine learning platform, H2O (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3). She is the author of a handful of machine learning related software packages (http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/software.html), including the h2oEnsemble (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master)!\n\nThe focus of this talk is scalable machine learning using the H2O R (http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/r) and Python (http://www.h2o.ai/download/h2o/python) packages. H2O (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3) is an open source, distributed machine learning platform designed for big data, with the added benefit that it's easy to use on a laptop (in addition to a multi-node Hadoop or Spark cluster). The core machine learning algorithms of H2O are implemented in high-performance Java, however, fully-featured APIs are available in R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, and also through a web interface.\n\nR and Python code with H2O machine learning code examples will be demo-ed live and are available on GitHub ( https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-tutorials#r-tutorials ) for attendees to follow along on their laptops.\n\nSince H2O's algorithm implementations are distributed, this allows the software to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. H2O currently features distributed implementations of Generalized Linear Models, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, GLRM), clustering algorithms (K-means), anomaly detection methods, among others. The ability to create stacked ensembles, or \"Super Learners\", from a collection of supervised base learners is provided via the h2oEnsemble (https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-r/ensemble) R package.",

There is NO PUBLIC WIFI in this venue (only eduroam), so it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to install the following packages that are required for participating:\n\n• flexdashboard\n\n• dplyr\n\n• reshape2\n\n• plotly\n\n• knitr\n\nIf you're not already familiar with R Markdown, then FYI you'll be getting down 'n' dirty with it this session (!), because Flex Dashboards are created by converting an R Markdown document into a grid oriented dashboard layout. The dashboard flexibly adapts the size of it’s plots and htmlwidgets to the containing web page, hence the name :)\n\nFor more info, here's a quick 3min read overview of R Markdown (http://karawoo.com/2015-04-27-wsu/syllabus/Rmarkdown.html).\n\nTimings: Doors Open 6pm, Tutorial Start ~6.30pm\n\nFeel free to bring your own food, it's allowed in this venue!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCode of Conduct: all participants are expected to adhere to our community Code of Conduct found in the 'About us'.",

NOTE: some core knowledge of R is required to benefit from this session!!\n\nAny ladies familiar with Shiny are encouraged to mentor at this session!!\n\nCAPACITY: as this is an informal learning event with a single instructor, space will be limited to a manageable number! Please RSVP (not Eventbrite this time) to register for this Knowledge Share.\n\nFEMALE PRIORITY: similarly due to limited capacity, female members will be given priority to sign-up. Any male learners wanting to attend, please do NOT use the RSVP and instead message Chiin nearer the event to see if there are spaces available.\n\nLOCATION: come to the main Birkbeck building (entrance via Torrington Square), and ask at the reception as you enter the building for instructions to room MAL 402\n\nPRE-REQUISITES: R & RStudio installed + attendees are expected to have basic understanding of core R activities (installing & calling packages & built-in datasets, basic data manipulation, some understanding/ability with ggplot2, awareness of syntax for writing functions).

Meetup RSVP do not count as registration.\n\nIt can be hard to make your first contribution to open source software. Both for technical and social reasons. This will be a very hands-on session where we learn a bit about the moving parts in an R package and how the R community conducts itself on GitHub. We'll poke around some popular R packages on GitHub and go over how to create a high quality issue, e.g. a feature request or bug report. We'll walk through the process of bringing a package into your local environment, making a small change, and sending a pull request. You're encouraged to bring a laptop that's ready for work with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub (basically this:\n\nhttp://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up\n\n). If that's too daunting, don't be discouraged. Come as you are and you can watch me and a friendly neighbor walk through the steps.\n\nSpeaker: Jenny Bryan\n\nBio: Jenny is a recovering biostatistician who takes special delight in eliminating the small agonies of data analysis. Specific tools and mental models can make it easier for a data analyst to settle into a productive, alpha-to-omega workflow. She's been using R/S for over 20 years and is an Ordinary Member of the R Foundation. Jenny is working as a developer for RStudio and is Associate Professor of Statistics (on leave) at the University of British Columbia. She serves in the leadership of rOpenSci and Forwards.\n\nVenue: Room TBC\n\nSponsor: TBD (want to sponsor this meetup?

    "title": "Hadley Wickham: What's new in the dplyr 0.7.0",
    "description": "In this talk, I'll introduce you to some of the new features in dplyr 0.7.0. To warm up, we'll start of with some of the smaller stuff: new verbs (like pull() and the scoped variants), new data sets, and improved support for case_when(). Next, we'll talk about dplyr and databases and the new dbplyr package. Finally, we'll finish off with the mind-bending tidy evaluation and show how you can write your own\nfunctions that work in the same way as dplyr functions.\n\nTo get the most of this talk, you should be familiar with the basics of dplyr (e.g. the six key verbs)\n\nBio:\nHadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun. His work includes packages for data science (the tidyverse: including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, and readr) and principled software development (roxygen2,\ntestthat, devtools). He is also a writer, educator, and speaker promoting the use of R for data science. Learn more on his website, http://hadley.nz .\n\nOther events of interest:\nHadley will talk about the tidyverse at the London School of Economics on the 24th July, we highly recommend to attend both events!\nMore info here: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/expressing-yourself-using-r-with-hadley-wickham-tickets-35968638165?aff=es2\n\nSponsor:\nThis event is kindly sponsored by Mango Solutions.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTE: Places are limited, to register please get a free ticket on Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/hadley-wickham-whats-new-in-the-dplyr-070-tickets-35877882713 .

    "title": "Tutorial: Solving iteration problems with purrr",
    "description": "The biggest R conference, useR! (https://user2017.brussels/), is coming up! 4 days packed with tutorials and talks - but don't despair if you can't make it:\n\nCharlotte Wickham is visiting us! She will be giving a condensed version of her useR! tutorial (https://user2017.brussels/tutorials) on the purrr package for solving iteration problems.\n\nCharlotte is a part-time Assistant Professor of Statistics at Oregon State University, specialist in R training and course developer for Data Camp. Her DataCamp courses are Writing functions in R (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r) - with her brother, Hadley Wickham - and Working with Geospatial Data in R. (https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-r)\n\nPlease see below for more details on the (standard) purrr tutorial including pre-requisites (hint: beginner/intermediate level and please install some packages beforehand as there is no public wifi):\n\nNote: This a place holder- registration is only through Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tutorial-solving-iteration-problems-with-purrr-tickets-35443224639\n\nOutline\n\nCode with a lot of duplication is harder to understand, troubleshoot and maintain. The goal of this tutorial is help you remove duplication in your code by using functions that write `for` loops for you.\n\nYou'll learn to use the functions in the `purrr` package to perform iterative tasks: tasks that look like \"for each _____ do _____\".\n\nBy the end of the tutorial you'll be writing code that is more readable and easier to update and you'll be ready to solve new iteration problems faster and with fewer mistakes.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the tutorial, you'll be able to:\n\n• Move from solving a problem on a single element, to iterating that solution over many elements with `map()`.\n\n• Identify when to use the typed variants of `map()`: `map_lgl()`, `map_int()`, `walk()` etc.\n\n• Iterate over two arguments with `map2()`.\n\n• Leverage `purrr` to get list data into tibbles.\n\n• Use `purrr` to work with list columns in tibbles.\n\nPre-requisites\n\nDon't worry if you have never written a `for` loop, used `lapply()`, written your own function or heard of a `tibble`, this tutorial is designed to be accessible to beginners.\n\nThat said, you should be familiar with exploring and subsetting the basic data structures in R including lists and data frames.\n\nThis is a hands-on tutorial, you'll need your laptop with R installed, as well as a few packages:\n\n```\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"jennybc/repurrrsive\")\n\n```\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCode of Conduct: We expect all attendees to abide & be governed by our community CoC (https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct).",

Once we've collected data (!) on the community coding experience, we can organise specific events for the appropriate technical levels :)\n\nWorkshop requirements:\n\n-Laptop with R & RStudio installed\n\n-Packages: dplyr, ggplot2, ggsignif\n\n-Data to download: https://github.com/datacarpentry/R-genomics/blob/gh-pages/data/Ecoli_metadata.csv\n\nWiFi: ONLY eduroam will be available!! If you're doing the workshop & don't have eduroam access, please ensure you've addressed the above requirements in advance.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the presentation, we are delighted to have Vicky Butt giving us a bioinformatics talk and workshop aimed at R beginners/intermediates, researchers/students in life sciences, and curious individuals! She will be talking about what bioinformaticians do, and how to learn bioinformatics. This will then be followed by a workshop analysing and visualising genomic data in R.\n\nVicky is doing a bioinformatics PhD at King’s College London studying metabolomics of microbiota. Her first degree was in Neuroscience, but then moved into computational biology and did a Masters in Systems Biology after discovering the power of programming for research. She hopes to encourage more researchers to learn to code, especially minority groups in STEM.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMandate: as a civil service organisation we believe in the Equality Act 2010's Public Sector Equality Duty of advancing equality of opportunity between people who share a protected characteristic and those who don’t, in this case complying by explicitly promoting the currently underrepresented minority genders in STEM.",

What do you mean you've never heard about Tidy Tuesdays? It's a brilliant data project developed by R4DS learning community to promote the use of R language in Data Science and link mentors and learners. How?\n\nEvery Tuesday a raw dataset will be posted and an original chart associated with that dataset. The goal is to apply your take on the chart. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of Tidy Tuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater RStats community! So everyone of all skills should participate!\n\nRemember, done is better than perfect! It's better to show the progression of your skills with something basic but quick than something very sophisticated but tedious!\n\nAt the end of the meetup we will publish our graphs and code on Twitter with #TidyTuesday hashtag (fanfares)!\n\nSo get ready for a fun and hands-on meetup with lots to learn and explore!\n\nAgenda:\n\n5:30pm - doors open (pizza and drinks won't last forever!)\n\n6pm - quick intros and hellos from R-Ladies and hosts\n\n6:15ish pm - start TidyTuesday-ing!!\n\n8:45ish pm - publish our amazing work\n\nSee you all there!\n\nWe would like to say thanks to our sponsor tech recruitment agency RedCat Digital and to our hosts online mortgage broker Habito. Together with them, we are pleased to promote diversity and create a community of minority genders in the data space!",

If that wasn't enough, she's also an R-blogger, data enthusiast, organiser of MünsteR, animal lover, ballroom and latin dance teacher! You can read her award-winning blog here: https://www.shirin-glander.de/\n\nShirin will talk about using R to build an interpretable imagine recognition models.\n\nABOUT THE TALK\n\nKeras is a high-level open-source deep learning framework that by default works on top of TensorFlow. Keras is minimalistic, efficient and highly flexible because it works with a modular layer system to define, compile and fit neural networks. It has been written in Python but can also be used from within R. Because the underlying backend can be changed from TensorFlow to Theano and CNTK (with more options being developed right now) it is designed to be framework-independent. Models can be trained on CPU or GPU, locally or in the cloud. Shirin will show an example of how to build an image classifier with Keras. We'll be using a convolutional neural net to classify fruits in images. But that's not all! We not only want to judge our black-box model based on accuracy and loss measures - we want to get a better understanding of how the model works. We will use an algorithm called LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to find out what part of the different test images contributed most strongly to the classification that was made by our model. Shirin will introduce LIME and explain how it works. And finally, she will show how to apply LIME to the image classifier we built before, as well as to a pre-trained Imagenet model.\n\nMEETUP AGENDA\n\n18.00 - 19.00: Doors open and networking.\n19.00 - 19.15: Intro in the Data Science at Farfetch\n19.15 - 20.30: Shirin's talk + questions\n~20.30 - ~21.00: networking\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to say thanks to our sponsor; tech recruitment agency RedCat Digital (https://www.redcat-digital.com/), and to our hosts global ecommerce platform Farfetch (https://www.farfetch.com/uk/).

    "title": "Data Science for Social Good: a Presentation by Lisa Green and Rayid Ghani",
    "description": "A growing number of institutions and companies have moved to a data-driven approach to face increasingly complex research questions. An investigation of social change mechanisms has become particularly important for policy making, and data science provides a great opportunity to Social Good Organizations to work out successful strategies and achieve their goals. But who will bring together Social Good Organizations and data scientists?\n\nLisa Green and Rayid Ghani launched the non-profit organization, Data Science for Social Good (DSSG), whose primary aim is to implement an online marketplace for matching volunteer data scientist with social good projects. The platform combines community-based motivation and expert cooperation, innovative tools and parallel workflow. If you are a data scientist, a worker for social good (or both), but especially a person who cares and developed a curiosity for this topic, you must come and listen to Lisa and Rayid! We are looking forward to seeing you at the talk!\n\nSpeaker: Lisa Green & Rayid Ghani\n\nEssential bio: Lisa is the executive director of the non-profit organization Data Science for Social Good, and advisor of Domino Data Lab. Rayid is a renowned data scientist and started the project Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship.\n\nDoors will open and snacks and drinks will be served at 18:30. The talk will start at 19:00.\n\nVenue: BT-Centre HQ office in A1 (1st floor event centre).\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nPlease reserve your ticket on Eventbrite at the link https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/data-science-for-social-good-a-presentation-by-lisa-green-tickets-49245085376",

    "description": "**Please note**: registration for this event is via Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008\n\n# Speaker details\n\nGrace Meyer is a commercial analytics expert with proven success in advising business strategy based on data driven insights. She is currently based in London and works for the economics consultancy Oxera where she applies machine learning to strategic projects and is developing the data science and programming team. She is a mentor in the R-Ladies London chapter, uses R on a daily basis to crunch data and problem solve and presented at both UseR! and EARL last year.\n\n# Dive into dplyr\n\nData is seldom already in a tidy format for you to start analysis on straight away. My personal experience confirms that about 80% of the analytics work-flow is massaging and crunching data into a useful state. R is a master of analytics and modelling which would be useless without its strong data manipulation functionality, especially from the tidyverse package dplyr. In this session we will learn the main verbs of dplyr and link them together with the magrittr pipe to create new data sets and get insight from our data. Then we will take a look at the verb extensions and other package functionality.\n\n# What to bring\n\nThe session will be hands on so bring your own laptop with dplyr installed (examples will be based on in-build data sets). If you don't have the set-up, come along anyway to learn about this famous package.\n\n# Important to know\n\nThis meetup will be aimed at all R abilities.\n\nDoors: 6:30pm\nStart: 7:00pm\n**Please note**: registration for this event is via Eventbrite: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dive-into-dplyr-tickets-43071163008",

For example, the number of neighbors in a nearest-neighbor classification model. The tidymodels collection or R packages are a tidyverse interface to modeling. In this talk, the new tune package will be introduced. Examples of the tidy interface to model tuning will be demonstrated.\n\nMax Kuhn is a software engineer with RStudio and formerly of Pfizer. Max is a leader in the R community on predictive modelling. He is the author of the caret package and the book Applied Predictive Modelling. (https://resources.rstudio.com/authors/max-kuhn)",

As one of several alternative approaches to forecasting future trends using past information, ARIMA is a flexible but also powerful ‘semi-parametric’ method for forecasting and fitting longitudinal (aka panel) data, and there is also a user-friendly R implementation. In contrast to more inferential tools like Cox survival models, ARIMA models can make useful, potentially more accurate forward predictions with relatively sparse datasets, and they can be very useful for surfacing initial evidence of causal trends for further validation.\n\nARIMA can be used for everything from forecasting highly seasonal sales trends for food products, to the main example we’ll work through: surfacing a potential link between delayed discharges of hospitalised NHS patients and the unusual increase in English mortality rates since 2015.\n\nThe workshop does not presuppose any prior experience with time series/panel data analysis, but it will be helpful to have some statistical background as well as basic R skills. Bring your laptops! Data and code will be circulated on Github.\n\nThe talk will be given by Jules Shen, who is a statistical consultant with the Health Foundation, working primarily with the Improvement Analytics Unit. She is also a part-time PhD student in public health and policy at the LSHTM, who previously worked in development/health economics and management consultancy. Jules’ wife has worked out that her optimal day is a generalised linear function of pet budgies + ramen noodles.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6pm - snacks and networking for R-Ladies and hosts [lower ground floor downstairs; LSHTM refectory]\n\n6:30ish pm – workshop starts! [upstairs in 1st floor John Snow lecture theatre, please note that no food is allowed in the lecture theatre]\n\n8:00ish pm - end of workshop!",

If this is the first time you have heard about Julia then prepare to be impressed. She has a PhD in Astrophysics, been a keynote speaker a multiple conferences and has written a book about tidy text mining (https://www.tidytextmining.com/) together with David Robinson. You are not going to want to miss this!\n\nAbout the talk\nText data is increasingly important in many domains, and tidy data principles and tidy tools can make text mining easier and more effective. In this talk, learn how to manipulate, summarize, and visualize the characteristics of text using these methods and R packages from the tidy tool ecosystem. These tools are highly effective for many analytical questions and allow analysts to integrate natural language processing into effective workflows already in wide use. Explore how to implement approaches such as measuring tf-idf, topic modeling, and building classification models.\n\nSee you all there!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThank you to Mumsnet for hosting us.",

These kinds of models are often used in longitudinal studies or with time series data. They are powerful as the used maximum likelihood approximations rather than least squares, meaning they can better handle missing data, and competing models can be compared directly. By the end of the workshop you should have a basic grasp of the linear mixed model, how to specify one, how to compare models and how to plot results.\n\nThe workshop is held by Athanasia Monika Mowinckel, or Mo for short, who is a staff scientist at the Center for Lifespan changes in brain and cognition (LCBC: www.oslobrains.no). She has a PhD in psychology, and loves plotting. And cats. She is a co-founder and current head of the R-Ladies Oslo chapter.\n\nAgenda:\n\n6pm - doors open quick intros and hellos from R-Ladies and hosts\n\n6:30ish pm - quick intros and hellos from R-Ladies and hosts\n\n6:40ish pm - workshop starts!!\n\n8:30ish pm - end of workshop!\n\nSee you all there!",

So make sure you have some snacks, drinks and some cool webcam background on (behind) you!\n\nMeetup ProgRam\n19:30 - welcome to Rladies remote lightning talks!\n19:40 - Megan Stodel: \"Alternatives to iris\"\n20:00 - Jyoti Bhogal: \"Exploring R Package: janitor\"\n20:20 - Fiona Tweedie: \"Flexdashboards for understanding communities\"\n20:40-21:30 - Remote Socialising!\n\nABSTRACTS\n\nMegan Stodel, \"Alternatives to iris\"\nThe commonly used iris dataset was first published by eugenicist R A Fisher. Let's use datasets that aren't connected with racists. This talk will offer alternatives, as well as highlighting lots of places to search when you need data for your projects, training and exploration.\n\nJyoti Bhogal, \"Exploring R Package: janitor\"\nMost data projects usually begin with cleaning the data. It can take a lot of efforts, which can otherwise be useful while the acutual analysis. 'janitor' does exactly that when combined with 'here' and 'lintr'.\nLet's explore this further!\n\nFiona Tweedie: \"Flexdashboards for understanding communities\"\nThis talk would introduce the use of Rmarkdown and flexdashboards to make official statistics such as Census or Deprivation data accessible to communities in a visual way. Particularly relevant with Census 2021 in the UK, and other countries, as well as Deprivation statistics just having been released in UK nations.",
