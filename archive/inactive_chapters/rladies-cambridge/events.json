    "title": "Reproducible computation at scale with drake",
    "description": "The techniques in this tutorial enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of complicated projects with long runtimes. The drake R package resolves the dependency structure of data analysis pipelines, skips tasks that are already up to date, and cleanly organizes the output. Workflows with drake are efficient to maintain, and they provide tangible evidence that the results are synchronized with the underlying code and data, which increases one’s ability to trust the conclusions of the research.\n\nLearning objectives:\n1. Function-oriented programming: participants will learn to express data analysis tasks as user-defined\nfunctions, experience the advantages of functions relative to imperative scripts, and understand the role\nof functions in drake-powered projects.\n2. Declarative workflows: students will declare targets to represent data analysis artifacts, identify the\ndependencies of those targets, and inspect the emergent dependency structures of entire workflows.\n3. Project maintenance: students will experience drake’s responses to changing code and data, and they\nwill understand the conditions that allow drake to skip computation and save time.\n4. Large plans: participants will practice declaring large collections of targets compactly using drake’s\ndomain-specific language.\n\nComputing requirements:\nEach participant must have a laptop with a web browser and the ability to connect to the internet. Students will spend most of their time\nworking through R notebooks and supporting Shiny applications.\n• notebooks: https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/tree/master/inst/notebooks\n• learndrakeflow app: https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow\n• learndrakeplans app: https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeplans\n• drakeplanner app: https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner\nOnline RStudio Server instances will be provided so participants can interact with the notebooks without\nneeding to install anything locally.\n\nThe instructor:\nWill Landau received his PhD in Statistics at Iowa State University in 2016. His dissertation research\nintroduced a novel fully Bayesian, hierarchical model-driven, GPU-accelerated approach to the analysis of heterosis gene expression data (Landau, Niemi, and Nettleton 2019). He currently works at Eli Lilly and\nCompany, where he develops capabilities for clinical statisticians.\nWill is the creator and maintainer of rOpenSci’s drake R package. His most recent presentations on drake are the rOpenSci Community Call on September 24, 2019 (video recording at https://ropensci.org/commcalls/\n2019-09-24) (Landau and Butland 2019) and a half-day workshop at R/Pharma 2019 (Landau 2019).\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/wlandau/\nhttps://wlandau.github.io\nhttps://github.com/wlandau",

    "title": "Data Federation and R",
    "description": "Analysing big health data requires research workflows that balance computational efficiency with strict data governance, particularly relevant to healthcare data sources. This talk explores how the R programming language can be used to build reproducible and scalable research pipelines using R. We will also look at R capabilities that enable Federated analysis of health data. Attendees will gain practical insights into developing, deploying, and running R-based pipelines to process sensitive data securely and efficiently, while generating actionable results.",
