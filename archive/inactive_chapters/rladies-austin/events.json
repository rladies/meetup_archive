RSVPs are limited to the first 30 sign-ups, so please reserve your spot ASAP!\n\nWe are so pleased to welcome Steph Locke, CEO of Locke Data, to present this workshop! Steph generously extended her trip to Texas for the IT/Dev Connections Conference to include a stop in Austin and we're very grateful to have her here with us.\n\nAbout the Workshop\n\nThere have been some changes in R for data science over the past few years. Work hands-on with new packages and ways of doing things to achieve awesome models in many fewer lines of code.\n\nUsing packages like dplyr, broom, modelr, recipes, h2o, and furrr we’ll see how we can go from getting data to having an amazing model in no time at all.\n\nThis practical day will give people with experience in data science a new set of tools to implement and help them be more productive, whilst for people relatively new to data science it’ll help them get started quickly.\n\nAbout Steph\n\nSteph is the founder of a consultancy in the UK. Her talks, blog posts, conferences, and business all have one thing in common – they help people get started with data science. Steph holds the Microsoft MVP award for her community contributions. In her spare time, Steph plays board games with her husband and takes copious pictures of her doggos.",

    "description": "Hello Ladies!\n\nWe are excited to announce our next book club book, Invisible Women: Data Bias in a World Designed for Men. This book was suggested to us by one of our R-Ladies Austin members Sue!\n\nYou can find the book here: https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed/dp/1419729071\n\nAs of today all copies at the Austin Public library are out so must be a good read! Check back later or place a hold on a copy here: https://austin.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2062372067\n\nShould be a great read and engaging discussion over a brew--coffee or beer or tea at Thunderbird! More info on the book below. We hope to see you there!\n\nFrom Amazon about the book: \"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.\n\nCelebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women†‹, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.\"",

    "description": "We're very happy to be hosting an evening with Claus Wilke, Professor and Department Chair of Integrative Biology at UT Austin, and author of the recently released Fundamentals of Data Visualization book (https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).\n\nCOMPANION MEETUP: BOOK DISCUSSION\nThis talk is a follow-up to our book club meetup, where we'll be discussing Claus's new book, Fundamentals of Data Visualization. You can RSVP for that book discussion here: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/events/260447257/. Note that the book is code/language agnostic and will make for a great intro to all of the plots and concepts that Claus will cover in his talk.\n\nDESCRIPTION\nThe R package ggplot2 provides a powerful and flexible approach to data visualization, and it is suitable both for rapid exploration of different visualization approaches and for producing carefully crafted publication-quality figures. However, getting ggplot2 to make figures that look exactly the way you want them to can sometimes be challenging, and beginners and experts alike can get confused by themes, scales, coords, guides, or facets. We will discuss best practices for getting the most out of ggplot2, including how to choose and customize scales, how to theme plots, and when and how to use extension packages.\n\nLOCATION\nDell Medical School\nHealth Learning Building\nMain Auditorium Room 1.111\n1501 Red River Street\nAustin TX, 78712\n\nPARKING\nParking in the closest parking lot 108 is restricted to those with UT Austin parking permits. Metered parking is available nearby on Red River Street and Trinity Street. Paid parking is also available in the Health Center Garage at the corner of 15th Street and Trinity.\n\nSCHEDULE\n6:30 - 7pm -- Food and networking\n7 - 8:30pm -- Claus's talk\n8:30 - 9pm -- Questions, wrap-up, and close",

If you're interested in learning more about how to create the figures using ggplot2 and R, please check out Claus's follow-up talk: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-austin/events/260426142/\n\nPlease join us for a discussion over a beer or coffee/tea!\n\nFINDING THIS BOOK\n\nThis book is available free online at https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/.\n\nA hard copy of this book will be released on April 15th -- here's a link to order the book on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Visualization-Informative-Compelling/dp/1492031089.",
