You are welcome to come if you have NEVER used R before, and you are welcome to come if you use R every day. Advanced users will have plenty of opportunities to help beginners with debugging. We will be learning collaboratively.\n\nPrior to the meetup, please download the latest version of R and RStudio on your laptop (in that order). Below are the links for downloads\n\nhttps://cran.rstudio.com/\n\nhttps://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\n\nSince we plan to have refreshments at this meetup, we kindly ask you to RSVP only if you are *sure* that you will be coming. At the last meetup, we ended up with too much food because fewer people came than RSVPed, and we’d prefer not to have the same problem this time.",

Specific topics may include Decision Trees, ensemble methods (gradient boosting vs. bagging/bootstrapping), Random Forests, and Neural Networks. Attendees can expect a very high-level overview of techniques, a review of the circumstances under which they are and aren't appropriate for use, and a brief crash course on how to implement each using R!\n\nPlease note:\n\nThis meetup is not appropriate for very beginner level R users, we expect you to be familiar with fundamental R objects and functions.\n\nParking: Park in any spot marked \"Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory\". There should be more than enough available- all are free. If you find that these spots are filled - park anywhere in surrounding lots and Katie will give you a day pass for your dashboard.\n\nCall Katie if any issues finding it (440-452-6423).\nDirections and map also available here:\nhttp://columbuscollaboratory.com/Contact",

The package provides tools for shaping a user-interface and providing reactive elements dependent on user input. This is all achieved while maintaining the functionality and flexibility of R. This 2 hour workshop will serve as an introduction to the Shiny framework, demonstrating some of its uses. It will include hands-on coding, so feel free to bring a charged laptop with R and RStudio installed.",

    "title": "4-Week Introduction to R Workshop",
    "description": "Hi all!\n\nI'm leading a 4-session Introduction to R workshop!\n\nThis workshop is designed for the absolute beginners and does not require any programming experience!\n\nProgram\n\nI will start with R basics in the first two sessions and move on to data visualization with ggplot2 for the last two. However, the content of the last session can be changed depending on the class preference.\n\nSession 1 – Setting up R and R Studio (if necessary), R programming basics (R objects, data types (classes))\n\nSession 2 – Subsetting datasets\n\nSession 3 – Data visualization 1\n\nSession 4 – Data visualization 2 (subject to change)\n\nWhere & When\n\nFrom July 11th to August 1st, we will meet every Tuesday from 4 PM to 7 PM in 111 Parks Hall, College of Pharmacy, OSU\n\nSee on Google Maps: goo.gl/maps/r16Z29xBjuS2\n\nI am expecting each session to be about 2 and half hours (but it's always a good idea to be a little flexible to allow some extra time for Q & A or issue solving).\n\nThe spots in this class are limited to 90 and the registration will be closed automatically after 90 RSVPs.\n\nParking\n\nFor folks that don’t have normal OSU parking, there is a guest garage located directly across the street from Parks Hall that is open to all visitors: North Cannon Garage (http://osu.campusparc.com/home/garages/wexner-medical-center/north-cannon-garage - 1640 Cannon Drive). You could also extend the parking to the 12th Ave Garage (http://osu.campusparc.com/home/garages/wexner-medical-center/12th-avenue-garage - 340 W 12th Ave). For those who have OSU parking, there's a parking lot for A, B and C class permits at the intersection of Cannon Dr and John H Herrick Dr.\n\nI would like to collect information on prospective students in terms of level programming experience. Don't worry if you have no experience with coding. The course is designed for absolute beginners, however I might potentially have different suggestions for you if you are experienced with other programming languages. So please fill out this form (https://goo.gl/forms/fFD8c8HWPN7aiMY32) to give some information about yourself.\n\nSee you all in class!",

    "description": "We will be talking about tidyr & dplyr packages, and show how these packages make data cleaning much less painful & provide easy to use functions for the first steps of data exploration. After a short presentation about \"tidy data\" and tidyr & dplyr, we will do practical examples and go over the vignettes provided by Hadley Wickham (the creator of the tidyverse).\n\nBring your laptop, extension cord (if you have battery issues), and your enthusiasm! Although tidyverse doesn't require much R experience, we expect you to be familiar with R, RStudio, loading data & packages into R and basic understanding of base R class types.\n\ntidyr examples require certain data files so:\n\n- Please download them via dropbox from here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nkhrhcgx6ogg24j/AACKLaJq5_8VDQHmlhZfluCOa?dl=0)\n\n- Or if you're familiar with GitHub get it from the tidy repo (https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr) under vignettes.\n\nSince we plan to have refreshments at this meetup, we kindly ask you to RSVP only if you are sure that you will be coming.\n\nLinks to Google maps locations: College of Pharmacy, Parks Hall (https://goo.gl/maps/BXHrWseC3wq), Closest parking (https://goo.gl/maps/vp4jypHympS2)",

That's okay - still come and help with/learn from the troubleshooting. This could be a wide range of problems (i.e., data cleaning, regex, visualizations, model fitting conundrums, parralelization). Basically if it's something you might find on stackoverflow and it involves R, it's appropriate for this session. Then during the session we will, together, work through as many of the posted problems as we can to generate a (or multiple) solutions.\n\nWe will be abiding by stack overflow posting rules as posted here: https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask, so please follow to avoid rejection! Organizers will come with 1-2 examples of some gnarly R issues we recently tackled. Pizza will be provided courtesy of the Columbus Collaboratory.\n\nThis session is appropriate for R users of all levels, just please come with R already installed.\n\nSee you there!\n\nParking: Park in any spot marked \"Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory\".

We will cover several of the session talks and a few of the paid tutorials at a super high-level; with my goal being at the end to take a vote of attendees and pick one of the topics to dive deeper on at an upcoming RLadies. I hope to cover (~5 mins each) most of the following: gganimate package and keynote talk, glue package and talk, Roger Peng Beyond Syntax keynote talk, Fable and Fasster forecasting packages and talks, SEER package and talk, Jenny Bryan's Code Smells and Feels talk and key functions learned, MGCV/Beyond Linearity tutorial and content, Max Kuhn recipes package tutorial and content. Goal is to give attendees enough info such that they could go home, watch talk, and walk through any associated materials and tutorials on their own. Other goal: choose one of the packages associated with a talk or tutorial to dive deeper on together at a future RLadies.",

We're here to help (◕‿◕✿)\n\nAbout this meetup:\n\nUsing Shiny in consulting can be challenging, as all deployment options involve either sending intellectual property and data to the cloud or IT involvement. When providing consultative like services to extremely large, risk-averse, enterprises this can greatly restrict one’s ability to quickly get Shiny apps into users’ hands, as engagement of IT can take months if approved at all. We’ll share how the Columbus Collaboratory team overcame these barriers to rapid deployment by coupling R Portable and Electron, a framework for creating native applications with a variety of web technologies. All the tools needed to use Electron for desktop deployment of Shiny apps will be reviewed. We’ll highlight a specific example in which these technologies were used within a large enterprise to completely automate a weekly report. We’ll also share how the app used R Packages such as openxlsx, shinydashboard, RODBC, and Zoo to query an internal database, cleanse data, calculate key metrics, and create a downloadable excel file for dissemination. The best part? This Shiny app was delivered to the end business user as a stand-alone executable.\n\nParking: Park in any spot marked \"Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory\".

Fortunately, there are excellent tools built into R and RStudio that can make debugging easier. This talk will explore those tools, including: using base R functions for debugging, tracing techniques, setting breakpoints in RStudio, understanding debug mode, and troubleshooting more complicated sources like packages and Shiny applications.\n\n• What to bring\nCharged laptop and your enthusiasm!\n\n• Important to know\n\nThis meetup is not appropriate for very beginner level R users, we expect you to be familiar with fundamental R objects and functions.\n\nParking: Park in any spot marked \"Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory\".

    "description": "About this meetup and prep before meetup:\n\nWe will talk about the basics of version control with Git, and how this sometimes painful looking process can be made easy with RStudio and RStudio projects. This will be a repetition of a previous session, because this is a very crucial step for package development. So before we get into package dev, it would be nice to have these things set up first.\n\nPlease bring your laptop and have R and RStudio installed and working.\nYou can do everything we will do in this session on RStudio Cloud as well. But if you want to join us for a package development meetup later on you should have R, RStudio and Git installed on your computer. So we can connect these and it will be ready when the time comes for package dev. But if things don't work and you're having issues, don't worry! We're here to help (◕‿◕✿)\n\nAlthough anything you'll learn in this session can be used with any Git web repository, I'll mainly show examples via GitHub. If you don't have one yet please DON'T FORGET to create an account on https://github.com/ -- it's free!\n\nPlease make sure that you have git installed by typing\n\ngit\n\non your terminal and executing it. Git installation can be quite painful on Windows machines, but we will try to help you if you can't figure it out. If you're using a work laptop and don't have permissions to install things check with your IT department to make sure you can install all the software.\n\nHere are some introductory articles/links about Git:\nhttps://medium.com/@garstep/osn-what-the-hell-is-git-6afbe634c4e8\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nhttp://happygitwithr.com/\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial\n\nI would suggest looking at Installation chapter in happygitwithr if you have no idea how to install R, RStudio or Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html\n\nWe won't really have materials for this meetup, but I will ask you to potentially fork a repo from my github account: https://github.com/karaesmen/git_and_Rprojects\nYou can find a quick readme in there too.\n\nAs always pizza and soft drinks will be available courtesy of our great local supporter, the Columbus Collaboratory.\n\nParking: Park in any spot marked \"Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory\".

    "description": "Since no one came forward to host this meetup (yes ladies, this time I am totally fine being the bad cop, and will pick someone... 😈) I will present some ggplot2 material I had from before.\n\nFor those who are less familiar with ggplot2:\nIt is a wonderful and very popular data visualization package in R. It provides all sorts of functions to customize any bits and pieces you can imagine in a plot.\n\nBeginners are welcome, although some familiarity with R is needed. And if you are used to plotting with base R plot, I'd say it's time to spice things up with ggplot2!\n\nIn our last ggplot2 meetup we mainly talked about point (scatter) plots. I will pick up from there, show a more customized example and move on to plotting:\n- histograms\n- barplots\n- boxplots\n- doxplots\n- errorbars\n\nI know it's a little ambitious, so please let's all try to get there in time. (I'll try to do my best too 😅)\n\nMaterials will be available on R-Ladies github under meetup presentations repo of our chapter (https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_columbus) on the day of the meetup.\n\nPlease bring your laptop and have R and RStudio (and the tidyverse package) installed and working.

    "description": "This month we will take a short break from tidymodels and talk about containerization with Docker!\n\nDr. Stephanie LaHaye will introduce us to the world of Docker and will highlight the key reasons why Docker is an excellent and integral tool for anyone aiming to make their code more reproducible and shareable, and why it is essential when sharing to users in outside environments. We will learn how to launch Docker, check for images on our local systems, push and pull from Docker Hub, create a basic Dockerfile, and finally use it to run an Rscript.\n\nBefore the presentation, please install Docker by following the instructions for\n- mac (https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/)\n- linux (https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/)\n- windows (https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n\nStephanie will be presenting from her Mac and she will be using Mac Docker Desktop (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n\nYou can find the meetup materials at: https://github.com/sdl002/R_Docker_Intro\n\nStephanie is a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She attended Michigan State University for her undergraduate work where she received a bachelor of science in Genomics and Molecular Genetics and a bachelor of science in Human Biology. She then attended the Ohio State University for her PhD in Molecular Genetics, where she focused on cardiovascular genomics research. After graduate school Stephanie did a postdoc at the Institute for Genomic Medicine, focusing on the development of automated pipelines using serverless technology to handle next generation sequencing data for pediatric cancer patients.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nR-Ladies provides a harassment-free space to all who are interested to share and learn about R!*\n\nAre you a woman or gender-non-conforming person interested in speaking?

    "description": "A Crossover Event with Web Analytics Wednesdays (WAW)!: R Meets Digital Analytics (Hands-on!)\n\nThis month’s event will be a crossover with the WAW meetup! We will be mostly following the R-Ladies format, which means you can easily follow along with the speaker (Katie) she works through some code exploring a digital analytics data set. The WAW crew will bring the expertise on all things digital attribution and analytics to add some color to this particular business problem.\n\nNo previous coding experience is required in order for you to follow along! We will be using RStudio Cloud, which is a free, browser-based environment, so be sure to sign up for an account prior to the meetup.\n\nLink to RStudio Cloud project: https://rstudio.cloud/project/1443232\n\nAbout Web Analytics Wednesdays\nWeb Analytics Wednesdays are an opportunity for digital analysts, digital marketers, and anyone who is interested in learning more about digital analytics to get together and share their experiences. And strengthen the central Ohio digital marketing community in the process!\nAll of our Columbus WAWs are free of charge thanks to the generosity of our sponsors: Clarivoy, TeamBuilder Search, InfoTrust, and Claravine. While lately events have been online - be sure to follow WAW closely as there in-person events offer great opportunities for networking and connecting with digital analytics practitioners and leaders (plus - tasty food and beverages!)\n\nfor more info please visit cbuswaw.com",

    "description": "This month we are thrilled to have Dr. Connie Brett!\n\nShe will be talking about Shiny Enterprise Applications - considerations for success and tools to get it done right.\n\nThis will be a virtual meetup, so please scroll down to see the details about how to join the call!\n\nConnie will present in detail the challenges of designing and developing shiny applications for larger scaling and sharing (for example in an enterprise setting). She will talk in detail about scoping, planning, and tools for meeting these needs. The periscope R package will be introduced and used in a demonstration to show you how to start a shiny application that makes meeting these challenges easier so you can focus on the content of your application.\n\nConnie is the CEO, Founder, and Principal Data Scientist of Aggregate Genius Inc. located in British Columbia, Canada. She is responsible for analytics oversight as well as delivering on the corporate vision backing the \"Know what you KNOW\" philosophy of the company. She delivers demonstrations, concept proofs, statistical models, feasibility studies, and productionalized architectures centered around big-data and analytics products.\n\nBefore founding Aggragate Genius, she received her B.A from Knox College followed by an M.S. and Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in computational chemistry. So even though she's now settled in Canada, she has some roots in Columbus, OH! After 20 years focusing on producing solid analytical models, software and visualization tools, as well as custom IT solutions architecture, she also became an entrepreneur with Aggragate Genius. We asked her to also talk a little bit about her career path as well and will provide some time for career related questions from the audience.\n\nZoom information\n\nTopic: R-Ladies June Meetup\nTime: Jun 11, 2020 06:00 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://osu.zoom.us/j/91659975178?pwd=NFNVRmVyK0l3MldmdU1abkxmS1NQdz09\n\nPassword: rladies\n\nOne tap mobile\n+16468769923,,91659975178# US (New York)\n+16513728299,,91659975178# US (St. Paul)\n\nDial by your location\n+1 646 876 9923 US (New York)\n+1 651 372 8299 US (St. Paul)\n+1 301 715 8592 US (Germantown)\n+1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\n+1 408 638 0968 US (San Jose)\n+1 669 900 6833 US (San Jose)\n+1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\n+1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\nMeeting ID: 916 5997 5178\nPassword: 738583\nFind your local number: https://osu.zoom.us/u/adEVVVE5Fm\n\nJoin by SIP\n91659975178@zoomcrc.com\n\nJoin by H.323\n162.255.37.11 (US West)\n162.255.36.11 (US East)\n115.114.131.7 (India Mumbai)\n115.114.115.7 (India Hyderabad)\n213.19.144.110 (EMEA)\n103.122.166.55 (Australia)\n64.211.144.160 (Brazil)\n69.174.57.160 (Canada)\n207.226.132.110 (Japan)\nMeeting ID: 916 5997 5178\nPassword: 738583",

The tidymodels team has been hard at work over the past year plus building packages that building and training models easier and more streamlined. We've been super excited about it for a while and the great documentation we are so lucky to have from the tidyverse is now hitting the press - so let's learn about it together!\n\nBe patient with us - we are learning :) Katie will open up RStudio Cloud, and work through tutorials 1-5 linked above.

We are going to break into groups of 3 or 4 and work together on using the Tidy Tuesday Australian fires dataset to create a data visualization using R. We can dig into the data, hopefully create some cool visualizations, and gain some experience working to create something together.\n\nAt the end of the time, we can each show some results and maybe put them on Twitter to share with the broader R community. If at the end of the meetup, groups are not done and want to continue to work toward something more final, attendees are welcome to use the Slack channel to communicate and post questions and results.\n\nGo here to explore the Tidy Tuesday GitHub page about this week's dataset: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/readme.md\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nPlease come with a machine that can access rstudio.cloud.
