Please join us for the August R-Ladies Louisville Meeting on Wednesday August 29th at 6 PM at the U of L Harry Frazier Hall-College of Business Rm 226 (in the North Wing)!\n\nThis month Sam will be talking about Shiny in R! Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions. We welcome R-Ladies of ALL skill levels! We're still working on hammering out the details but they will be posted here as soon as we know. We hope to see you there!\n\nFor parking, the Speed Museum Parking Garage will be the closest option.\nThe garage is right next to the College of Business Building.\nThe Speed Museum address will get you close to the garage and then follow the signs for the garage: 2035 South Third Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40208.\n\nTo get to the meeting room: Exit the garage from the back and turn left to walk to the College of Business. There is a large red sculpture in the circle in front of the bldg. Walk up the sidewalk and enter the bldg. using the doors on the left (South Entrance). Take the elevator to the second floor and upon exiting immediately turn right. Room 226 is the first door on the right; just a few steps away.\n\nPlease share this meetup with all the R-ladies you know, the more the merrier! No previous R experience needed! You can e-mail us at louisville@rladies.com or sam@rladies.com with any further questions you may have! We look forward to learning with everyone!",

We will have coffee and treats! We will begin with a brief introduction/discussion of the purpose of R-Ladies Louisville.\n\nNext, Jennifer Thompson will lead us through an introduction to the purrr package (part of the tidyverse ecosystem). She'll help us feel more comfortable with lists; tell us why we would want to use purrr over other, similar tools; and lead us through a case study which demonstrates her favorite bits of purrr's functionality.\n\nJennifer is a biostatistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and co-organizer of R-Ladies Nashville. She currently works primarily on research related to patients suffering from critical illness, and uses R to clean and manage data, conduct study monitoring, perform and report statistical analysis, and create visualizations to disseminate and interpret results. She has a master's in biostatistics from the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and is currently excited about open science, traveling, and learning project management.\n\nFor parking the Speed Museum Parking Garage will be the closest option.\nThe garage is right next to the College of Business Building.\nThe Speed Museum address will get you close to the garage and then follow the signs for the garage: 2035 South Third Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40208.\n\nTo get to the meeting room: Exit the garage from the back and turn left to walk to the College of Business.
