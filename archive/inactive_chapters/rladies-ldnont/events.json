    "description": "Join us to learn about regression in RStudio. This month's meet up will be led by Jacqueline Kueper, PhD candidate in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Western.\n\nNo previous experience with regression or RStudio is required; all abilities are welcome. The main portion of the session will involve step-by-step instructions on how to set up, run, and interpret results from regression models that include one and more than one independent variable. We will also cover some background on three types of regression—linear, logistic, and Cox—including when and why you might want to run each of these models. Sample code and data will be made available so that you can follow along on a personal laptop; sitting back to absorb the conversation in a more hands-off way is also an option.\n\nGet excited! See you in December!",

The first time Daryn gave this talk back in summer 2017, she walked us through considerations for using R as an SPSS user from the perspective of a relatively new R user (as she was at the time!). She has since updated the presentation and will be leading it anew on Thursday, November 29th at 6pm. The workshop will involve learning how to think about your data in R as an SPSS user and to use commands for running statistical tests in both programs. She will also walk us through how to manipulate your data in R and output it in a ready-for-SPSS format for those who don't like data wrangling in Excel, but work with supervisors or colleagues who prefer to work with SPSS. Daryn is also a tidyverse fiend, and has a way of sprinkling helpful nuggets of useful tidy syntax throughout. Bottom line: there will be lots to learn, whether you're an SPSS user or not!",

    "title": "Intro to R programming and RStudio",
    "description": "Welcome back for another season of R-Ladies, London ON (#LdnOnt)! Our kickoff event this fall is an introductory crash course to R (i.e., using the R programming language) and RStudio (the integrated developing environment (IDE)/handy user interface for using R). All are welcome, be you a total newbie to R or even if you are a well-seasoned programmer looking to get a refresher on the basics.\n\nWe are extraordinarily excited to welcome back Cortney Hanna-Benson as our workshop leader. Cortney led our very first R-Ladies #LdnOnt workshop back in January 2017, and we have been looking forward to having her again ever since.\n\nIf you can, come with R and RStudio already installed, but if you have trouble or are unable to, don't let that hold you back. The workshop will be a mix of presentation and hands-on exercises. You are welcome to follow along actively or passively.\n\nHelpful links:\n- R-Ladies #LdnOnt website: https://rladiesldnont.netlify.com/\n\n- R download: https://www.r-project.org/\n- RStudio download: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/\n\n# FAQs\n\nDo I need to be an R expert?\n- No! While some familiarity helps, all levels are welcome! If you want to follow along, come with your laptop and have R and RStudio installed.\n\nI already know R, what's in it for me?\n- Awesome! Come join a community of people interested in STEM research, meet new pals, learn new skills or sharpen old ones, or talk to us about leading a workshop on a topic you're passionate about!\n\nI don't identify as a lady, but I still want to learn R - can I join?\n- Yes! While we prioritize underrepresented genders in leadership positions (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender), our general membership is fully inclusive. Read more about the global initiative at https://rladies.org/about-us/.\n\nI'm interested in leading a workshop in the future! How do I get in touch?\n- Great! You don't even need to be a full fledged \"expert\" to lead a workshop... this is a group for skill swapping. If you're interested, send us an email at ldnont@rladies.org.",

    "title": "Making science open with R!",
    "description": "Join us for our last meet up until the fall! We are thrilled to have Monica Granados back with us again to close out our second year! Monica comes with a wealth of experience using R and teaching others to use it. She's led numerous tutorials, many of which you can check out via the links below.\n\nThis meet up will focus on Open Science:\n\nFounded on the principle science should not be limited by your occupation, race, nationality or economic status, working in the open makes science more accessible by making methods, code, results and knowledge available to anyone, anywhere in the world. Imagine if every analysis you ever conduct from now on could be reproduced by anyone around the world. Or a method that gives you the power to integrate new data seamlessly complete with figures. In this workshop, we will be covering how to work in the open using R, R Markdown and Google Sheets. These three platforms allow us to host data, analyze, visualize data in one reproducible workflow. At the end of the workshop we will also discuss the wider movement of open science, how it is helping breakdown economic barriers in science and how you can contribute.\n\nLearn more about Monica by checking out her...\nWebsite: http://descienceblog.tumblr.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/monsauce\nR tutorials: http://qcbs.ca/wiki/r\n\nAs per usual, we will head to Milo's afterwards to celebrate, chat, and all in all just enjoy each other's company.\n\n-----\n(open science word cloud from here: https://www.um.edu.mt/library/departments/openscience)",

Once you have the hang of the added layer of syntax, Shiny is easy and versatile - however, the learning curve can be steep in the beginning. This session covers Shiny basics: what your file setup should look like (UI, server and helper files), different types of reactive variables and when to use them, and basic debugging. Examples of simple and complex Shiny applications will be demonstrated. The \"shiny\" package is required to participate and code a basic Shiny application.",

As usual, we will head out for food and drinks following the event (drinks and apps for presenters are on us!)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNB: Please note that, in keeping with the global R-Ladies mission, R-Ladies London, Ontario will prioritize female leadership and participation.

Come and join us to learn some common practices and procedures for data cleaning and exploration — how to get data into a ‘usable’ form and start looking at what they can tell you. We will touch on working with multiple datasets (joins) and strategies for when you need to learn more about your data or where they come from. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels!\n\nThere will be time for the group to skill-share and practice/troubleshoot; if you have new data that you are or will be working with this summer, bring it! Important to remember is that we are back at our home at the London Public Library Central Branch! We’ll be in the Stevenson and Hunt A Room - we’ll have signs! Parking is free if you park in the Citi Plaza lot - entrance on King. Bring your parking pass to the library’s main service desk and tell them you’re with R-Ladies to get your parking validated.\n\nLondon Public Library - Central 251 Dundas St London, Ontario Canada N6A 6H9\n\nAfter we’ve filled our heads with cleaning and exploration knowledge, we’ll explore our way right over to our favourite Milos’ for great beer and better company.

    "description": "Join us on Tuesday, November 12 at 6 pm to learn more about data viz. They say a picture's worth a thousand words... Does that apply to figures?\n\nWell, we think it does. Olivia Daub will be giving us a crash course in the Grammar of Graphics, taking us from the basics of ggplot2 to some fancy vizmagic with 3D graphics. Newbies and veterans alike will come away with new tricks, so don't miss it!\n\nCome with R and R Studio installed, as well as the following packages: ggplot2, scatterplot3d, gvlma, rgl, car, rcmdr, and psych. Mac users may need to have xQuartz installed to render 3D graphics.\n\nWe'll be in Room 2510 again at Elborn College (1201 Western Road). Parking is free after 4! This is our last meetup at Western, as we'll be back in our regular home at London Public Library starting next month (December 3rd)!!! We'll have signs up to guide you, just like last time. Detailed directions are on our website! (https://rladiesldnont.netlify.com/2019/10/17/2019-10-17-data-visualization-basics-to-3d/)\n\nPlease RSVP here, and tweet (https://twitter.com/RLadiesLdnOnt) us if you've got any questions or things you're dying to know that Olivia could try to touch on.",

Jaky Kueper will walk us through common practices and procedures for data cleaning and exploration—essentially how to get data into a ‘usable’ form and start looking at what they contain. We will touch on working with multiple datasets (joins) and strategies for when you need to learn more about your data or where they come from. Previous experience with R is not required.\n\nThere will be time for the group to skill-share and practice/troubleshoot; if you have new data that you are or will be working with this summer, bring it!\n\nJoin us for snacks and drinks at Milos' down the street after the meet up. As always, all are welcome.\n\nPlease note that there will be no summer R-Ladies sessions. Stay tuned for more details to come about future sessions.",

Using Google Maps to a certain degree is free, but you must enable billing.\nMedium wrote a good article explaining the process to help you: https://medium.com/superkoders/ultimate-guide-to-google-maps-d86ad945636a\n\nYou'll also need to install the following packages if you don't have them already. You can do this by running the line\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"gdata\", \"tidyverse\", \"ggmap\", \"viridis\"))\n\nIf you have trouble, feel free to reach out to us at ldnont@rladies.org.\n\nSee you then!

You can present on something you know well, something you’re in the midst of learning, or something you’d like to do and are just getting started with. These talks are a great way to get to know each other and get to know the work we all do, as well as get advice, support, and validation from your fellow R users. Please present! It’s a lot of fun in a safe space.\n\nYou can choose to have slides (e.g. PowerPoint) or live code in R or talk off the dome if you really want to! We use HDMI to connect to the library computer, and you can choose to send us slides in advance, bring materials on a USB, or connect your own device.\n\nCome! Talk! It’s fun!\n\nIf you’re interested in presenting, please fill out this survey (https://forms.gle/TQWiRGVbj2YxpUd89) so we have a sense of who is presenting and what we’ll hear. If you’re thinking about it but aren’t sure, reach out to us to chat about it! We’re easiest to contact on Twitter or via email.\n\nFor presenters and non-presenters alike, please RSVP on our Meetup.
