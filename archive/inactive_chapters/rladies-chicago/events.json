    "description": "At this meetup, Kaylene McClanahan will lead us through our first collaborative coding activity! Kaylene will briefly introduce us to R Markdown (a great tool for easily annotating your code, sharing it with others, and turning your results into reports), and then we will work together in small groups to address a highly important and socially relevant question--where can you find NYC's most raging parties?\n\nWe know the idea of coding with others can be daunting, but this is a safe space and everyone is welcome (even if you do not know how to use R yet). In fact, each group will be assigned a more experienced R user so this will be a great opportunity for beginners to see how other people deal with data in R! This will be a relaxed environment and a good chance to meet some of your fellow R Ladies, so please do not feel like you do not know enough to join in.\n\nIf you can, bring your computer!\n\nSchedule:\n6:00-6:10--Food and introductions\n6:10-6:30--Brief explanation of R Markdown and introduction to the NYC party dataset\n6:30-7:20--Groups will explore the data and use R Markdown to document their process/results\n7:20-7:45--Groups will share what they did with the rest of the group (if they want to!)",

Socialize with fellow R-Ladies and help us plan for 2019!\n\n**BEFORE THE EVENT: Please fill out our survey to provide feedback on our past and future R-Ladies Chicago programs. We are looking for as many Chicago-area R-Ladies as possible to fill out this survey, even if you cannot attend this Meetup or have not attended one in the past. We would love your input! See the survey here: https://tinyurl.com/rladies-survey\n\n• What we'll do:\nWe'll discuss best practices for working with survey data of all forms (e.g. numerical, strings, closed set, open response, etc.) in R. Then, we'll work together in small groups to analyze data from our End of the Year Survey in R. By the end of the Meetup, we hope to have developed a data-driven list of R-Ladies Chicago events & goals for 2019!\n\nWe'll also socialize with fellow R-Ladies over holiday-themed treats :)\n\nThere will be no formal technical talk at this meeting; rather, this will be a time to network with fellow R-Ladies while doing a collaborative coding activity. This is part of our “social” Meetups, focused on networking and idea exchange.\n\n• Collaborative Coding:\nWe know the idea of coding with others can be daunting, but this is a safe space and everyone is welcome (even if you do not know how to use R yet). Each group will be assigned a more experienced R user so this will be a great opportunity for beginners to see how other people deal with data in R!

Our mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community.

Wifi is available and live-tweeting is encouraged.\n\nIf you are interested in leading a small group for the collaborative coding activity (no preparation required, just bring in a laptop with R!) message the organizers via Meetup or email Katherine [at] rladies.org.\n\n• Important to know\nWe expect all attendees to abide & be governed by our community code of conduct.

Wine consumption is absolutely optional --we'll have non-alcoholic beverages & food too.\n\nWe'll also be introducing some R-Ladies Chicago outreach initiatives, including our new website: rladieschicago.org and kicking-off our Random Acts of Coffee program!\n\nThere will be no formal technical talk at this meeting; rather, a time to network with fellow R-Ladies while doing a collaborative coding activity. This is part of our “social” Meetups, focused on networking and idea exchange.\n\n• Collaborative Coding:\nWe know the idea of coding with others can be daunting, but this is a safe space and everyone is welcome (even if you do not know how to use R yet). Each group will be assigned a more experienced R user so this will be a great opportunity for beginners to see how other people deal with data in R!

We would prefer if the remaining spots are primarily reserved for women/female-identifying/non-binary individuals. This event is likely to be standing room only - arrive early if you want a seat!\n\nPlease RSVP on this Meetup page and on the Splash page located here: https://rladieschicagowelcomeschiefscientistatrstudiohadle.splashthat.com/\n\nRLadies Chicago is privileged to welcome Chief Scientist at RStudio, author of ggplot2 and many packages in the tidyverse, and perhaps the most prolific R developer of our time: Hadley Wickham.\n\nTalk Abstract:\nTidy evaluation is a new framework for non-standard evaluation that is used throughout the tidyverse. In this talk, I'll introduce you to the problem that tidy eval solves, illustrated with examples of the various approaches used in R. I'll then explain the most important components so that you can start writing your own functions instead of copying and pasting tidyr and dplyr code.\n\nSchedule:\n6:00-6:30 -- Food, introductions, and announcements\n6:30-7:15 -- Talk by Hadley\n7:15-8:00 -- Questions, networking\n8:00-9:30 -- Post-event at the Chicago Athletic Association's Drawing Room at 12 S Michigan Ave, Fl 2.\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/drawing-room-chicago\n\nBio:\nHadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun.

If you've used R, you've almost certainly used a package - but did you know that building your own package is actually not hard at all? If you have written bits of useful code you want to keep and return to, you might want a package.\n\nAfter this session, you'll have the skills to start a package and document your functions, and resources to use for next steps like vignettes and unit testing. If you like, bring an R function you have written, or follow along using provided scripts.\n\n**No experience with any package building (or even function writing) is necessary to follow along with this tutorial.**\n\nStephanie is a data scientist at Uptake, and along with the tutorial, a recruiter from Uptake will be on hand to talk to anyone thinking about applying to work there, so bring your resume too!\n\nSchedule:\n6:00-6:15--Food and introductions\n6:15-6:30--Recap of rstudio::conf by Amanda & Angela\n6:30-7:15--Workshop with Stephanie\n7:15-8:00--Questions, recruiting pitch from Uptake, networking\n\n• Sponsor information\nWeWork provides small businesses, startups, freelancers, large enterprises, and everyone in between with the workspace, community, and services they need to make a life, not just a living.

    "description": "Join us in welcoming Martin John Hadley (https://twitter.com/martinjhnhadley pronouns they/them) for an interactive workshop on htmlwidgets, Shiny, and reproducibility!\n\nData visualisation is an incredible tool for exploring, understanding and communicating the stories behind datasets. You might know about how to create static dataviz with R and ggplot2, but there's a whole zoo of htmlwidgets for creating interactive charts, maps, networks and more without learning any JavaScript. Add Shiny to the mix and you can create interactive web applications completely in R.\n\nBut something we often leave out of this conversation is how to make data truly accessible and reproducibly available for the future. Martin will tie together interactive dataviz, Shiny and their work at our R-Ladies Meetup to support an end-to-end reproducible Open Data workflow.\n\n• About Martin: Martin started learning R on May 29th 2015 to prepare for their role in IT Services at University of Oxford where they lucked out on internal funding to setup the \"Interactive Data Network\" (idn.it.ox.ac.uk), which supports Oxford researchers in creating interactive dataviz of Open Data using Shiny and htmlwidgets. Since founding the IDN, Martin has created several R training courses for LinkedIn Learning and as of 2019 is a full time freelance R consultant and trainer - they're also a die hard reproducible research evangelist.\n\n• Installation requirements:\nPlease have the following installed on your computer before this workshop (or come early and we'll help you with installation):\n- R\n- RStudio\n\nRun the following command in the R console to make sure you have the appropriate packages installed:\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"leaflet\", \"highcharter\", \"rmarkdown\", \"shiny\", \"fivethirtyeight\", \"sf\", \"rnaturalearthdata\")\n\n• Schedule\n5:45-6 -- Installation help, R Tour (please come early for help getting set up with R if you need it!)\n6-6:30 -- Food and drinks, Intros & Announcements\n6:30-7:30 -- Workshop by Martin\n7:30-8:00-- Socializing/Networking/Hanging out/Chillin'\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend this event?\nA: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

    "description": "**Note: This is one of two events happening this month for our Northside-Southside double header, one in Hyde Park on 9/24, and another in Evanston on 9/26. Choose one or attend both!**\n\nDr. Leah Welty will present: \"Collaborative Reproducibility: Connecting R/R Markdown and Microsoft Word using StatTag\"\n\nAlthough R Markdown can render documents to Microsoft Word, R/R Markdown users must sometimes transcribe statistical content in to separate Microsoft Word documents (e.g., documents drafted by colleagues in Word, or documents that must be prepared in Word), a process that is error prone, irreproducible, and inefficient. We will present StatTag (www.stattag.org), an open source, free, and user-friendly program we developed to address this problem. StatTag establishes a bi-directional link between R/RMarkdown files and a Word document, and supports a reproducible pipeline even when: (1) statistical results must be included and updated in Word documents that were never generated from Markdown; and (2) text in Word files generated from R/RMarkdown has departed substantially from original Markdown content, for example through tracked changes or comments. We will demonstrate how to use StatTag to connect R/RMarkdown and Word files so that all files can be edited separately, but statistical content –values, tables, figures, and verbatim output– can be updated automatically in Word. Using practical examples, we will also illustrate how to use StatTag to view, edit, and rerun R/RMarkdown code directly from Word. The talk will also include an overview of reproducible research in the collaborative research.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nLeah J. Welty, PhD is Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine and in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and is the Director of the Biostatistics Collaboration Center within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. She is also the Immediate Past President of the Association of Clinical and Translational Statisticians. She earned her PhD in statistics from the University of Chicago, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests include longitudinal and multilevel models, psychiatric epidemiology, and the development of reproducible research tools for clinical and translational science. She is the lead biostatistician for the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors in delinquent youth. She has led the development of StatTag, a free, open-source program to support reproducible research in clinical and translational science.\n\nSchedule\n4:30-5pm - Food, Intros & Announcements\n5-6pm - StatTag\n6-6:30pm - Socializing/Networking\n\n**This event is child-friendly!\nWe realize this is an earlier start time than our normal events and strive to make it accessible to all.

This event is kindly hosted and sponsored by Enova.\n\n*****Agenda*****\n6:00 - 6:30: mingling and settling in; food and drinks provided by Enova.\n6:30 - 6:40: Announcements and introductions (and lightening talks?)\n6:40 - ~7:25: Stephanie Kirmer speaks\n~7:25 - 8:00: more mingling and food\n\n*****About the Talk*****\nAdding animation to graphs can make visualizations eye-catching and effective for transmitting complex information to audiences. In this talk, attendees will learn about using animation in data visualizations in R using ggplot2 and gganimate. Topics will include: how to choose when an animation might (or might not) be an appropriate option for your use case, ways to make sure your visualization still communicates clearly and succinctly when animated, and a hands-on walk-through of how to turn a not-so-great static visualization into a great animated plot. The gganimate package will be the key tool discussed, and some familiarity with ggplot2 is recommended but not required.\n\n*****About the Speaker*****\nStephanie Kirmer is a Senior Data Scientist at Journera, a company that helps the travel industry coordinate and manage customer data efficiently and securely, to improve traveler experiences. Previously she worked at Uptake, where she developed tools for analyzing fuel efficiency, and constructed predictive models for diagnosing and preventing mechanical failure. Before joining Uptake, she worked on data science for social policy research at the University of Chicago. Stephanie holds an MA in Sociology from Portland State University and an MA in Social and Cultural Foundations of Education from DePaul University.\n\n***** R- Ladies ***\nWe are a group of women and non-binary individuals who code with the programming language R and support each other on our learning journey.\n\nPlease help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.\n\n• What to bring\nLaptop or notebook if you can!

    "title": "R-Ladies Chicago welcomes Mara Averick: Sustainers of the Tidyverse",
    "description": "Join us in welcoming tidyverse developer advocate and Twitter #rstats star Mara Averick!\n\n• What we'll do:\n\nSchedule:\n5:45-6 -- R tour for beginners; sign up here: https://tinyurl.com/rladiestour\n6-6:30 -- Food, Intros & Announcements\n6:30-7:10 -- Talk by Mara\n7:10-8:00 -- Socializing/Networking/Hanging out\n\nBio: Mara Averick is the tidyverse developer advocate at RStudio. She got into R by way of a long-time love for the NBA and (fantasy) basketball. When not catering to the every whim of her dogs, she can be found: perusing weird words; indulging her bibliomania; and/or watching, quantifying, and visualizing Archer.\n\nTopic: Sustainers of the Tidyverse\nAbstract: If a piece of open-source software is to survive its own success, it must have a healthy community of active contributors. The tidyverse, a collection of R packages for data science with a shared underlying design philosophy, has become popular in no small part because of its usability among those who do not consider themselves to be “programmers.” However, this active base of non-developer users has been a fruitful source of contributions as we’ve sought to highlight aspects of contributing to open source beyond committing lines of code. This talk will cover the technical tools, virtual spaces, and social norms that have enabled and empowered community contributions.\n\nFind Mara on Twitter: https://twitter.com/dataandme\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend this event?\nA: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor, as spots may be limited.

    "description": "R-Ladies organizers Angela and Katherine will each present talks on community building and teaching in the context of data science. Please join us!\n\nThese talks are a preview of Angela and Katherine's upcoming presentations at csv,conf,v5. Please join us to discuss these topics and let us know what you are interested in learning more about!\n\ncsv,conf,v5 is a community driven data conference on May 13 & 14. It is an event that's not literally about the CSV file format, but rather about what CSV represents to our wider community ideals (data interoperability, hackability, simplicity, etc.). Due to COVID-19, the conference is now 100% virtual and open to all. Find more information about csv,conf here: https://csvconf.com/\n\nAfter you RSVP, you will be provided the Zoom link to go to in order to attend this event.\n\n--------- Talk Abstracts ---------\n\nData Communities and Those Who Build Them\nAngela Li\n\nIn order to support the use of data in various contexts, it is important to have champions who demonstrate the value of tools, shepherd new users, and provide support to those learning to use data. In this talk, I’ll cover my experiences with data community building and share strategies from open source communities such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries, as well as the spatial data science community I support at my research center. I’ll discuss the value of the data community builder and their role within / outside of institutions for encouraging uptake of technical tools. Some of the skills needed for these roles may not be what you think: building relationships, being empathetic toward use cases (and users!), organizing events, teaching effectively, and setting strategy for expanding data networks, among others.\n\nLearner-centered teaching for the non-traditional data science classroom\nKatherine Simeon (with Diya Das & Angela Li)\n\nThere is considerable variability in how individuals learn computing skills. While many formal courses, both online and in-person, are available to learners, typical methods of learning are acquiring knowledge on-the-job and participating in short-term workshops. While these non-traditional contexts are highly successful, instructors are challenged to capitalize on a limited amount of time and resources, while catering to learners of different backgrounds and experience levels. In this talk, we will discuss how pedagogic research can be applied to computing & programming education in non-traditional settings (e.g., corporate training, 1-day workshops, and one-on-one mentorship). Specifically, we will explore how to modify established learning formats in order to address specific needs of learners. Finally, we will outline best practices to facilitate a collaborative and inclusive learning environment that can motivate both instructors and learners.\n\n--------- Schedule ---------\n\n6:00 - 6:10 -- Announcements & Intros\n6:10 - 6:30 -- Angela's Talk on Data Science Communities\n6:35 - 6:55 -- Katherine's Talk on Learner-Centered Teaching\n\n---------------------------------\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend this event?\nA: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

It has a built-in shiny app and saves results to a disk. It was written to show sambas to our English and Spanish-speaking friends, and a way to practice package writing and shiny, and to learn about APIs.\n\n🎉Stephanie Hickey on BRRR (by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu)\n\n“Have you ever wanted to know - and celebrate - when your scripts are finally done running in R? Have you ever been so proud of pulling off a tricky bit of code that you wanted Flavor Flav to yell \"yeaaahhhh, boi!!\" as soon as it successfully completes? Have you ever gotten an error message that felt like DJ Khaled yelling, \"They don't wanna see us win!\" Probably not, but you might now. And with BRRR, you can.”\n\n🗺️Kayla Johnson on personalized map art\n\nMap art makes beautiful posters. You can find them all over the internet and buy them even framed for your favorite city, area or country. In this tutorial, inspired by Esteban Moro’s “Personal Art Map with R”, you’ll learn how to create those street maps for your city.\n\n♟️Sneha Sundar on chess (by Niklas Fiekas)\n\nSneha will present the chess package. chess is a wrapper for R around python-chess, an amazing library created by Niklas Fiekas. It allows users to read and write PGN files as well as create and explore game trees such as the ones seen in chess books.\n\n- Q&A | Discussion\n\n=====\nTIME\n=====\nhttps://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RLEL%2FRLC%3A+Fun+with+R&iso=20210423T13&p1=77&ah=1&am=30",
