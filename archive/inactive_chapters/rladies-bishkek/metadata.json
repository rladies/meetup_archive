  "description": "**This is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global ([https://www.rladies.org](https://www.rladies.org)), an organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools.**\n\n**R-Ladies welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing, supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!**\n\n**We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account ([https://github.com/rladies](https://github.com/rladies)) and follow us on twitter ([https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal)) to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!**\n\n**Make sure you read and comply with our code of conduct (https://www.rladies.org/coc/).**\n\n**Please note that by taking part in an R-Ladies event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
