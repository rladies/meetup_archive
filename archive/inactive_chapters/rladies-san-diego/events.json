See below for a brief outline of the evening:\n\n6:00pm - 6:30pm: Arriving and socializing\n6:30pm - 7:00pm: Jenny Bryan Talk\n7:00pm - 7:30pm: Hadley Wickham Talk\n7:30pm - end of meeting: Socializing\n\nTALKS\nJenny will discuss strategies for setting up your R life in general, as well as reusable patterns for data analysis projects.\n\nHadley's topic is TBA.\n\nEach talk will be about 25 minutes.\n\nBIOS\nJenny is a recovering biostatistician who takes special delight in eliminating the small agonies of data analysis. Specific tools and mental models can make it easier for a data analyst to settle into a productive, alpha-to-omega workflow. She's been using R/S for over 20 years and is an Ordinary Member of the R Foundation. Jenny is working as a developer for RStudio and is Associate Professor of Statistics (on leave) at the University of British Columbia. She serves in the leadership of rOpenSci and Forwards.\n\nHadley is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun. His work includes packages for data science (the tidyverse: including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, and readr) and principled software development (roxygen2, testthat, devtools). He is also a writer, educator, and speaker promoting the use of R for data science. Learn more on his website, http://hadley.nz .",

    "description": "Let's learn more about R by exploring some of the packages in the tidyverse.\n\nAccording to RStudio, \"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures\". It's also an amazing way to quickly and easily get started with R.\n\nJoin us in a journey through some of the tidyverse as we learn how to import, manipulate and plot data.\n\nThis meetup will be suitable for beginners and those that have never used R. However, I'd like to also ask those that are already proficient to attend. We can always use your help during the tutorials!\n\nWe are looking forward to seeing you all there!\n\nThings to do ahead of time:\n\n- Download and install R (https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)\n- Download and install RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n- Install the tidyverse package (install.packages(\"tidyverse\"))\n\nAlso, please download the files from https://github.com/rladies-san-diego/2019-10-10_tidyverse-tutorial\n\nWe are meeting at UCSD's biomedical library building, rooms 106-107 at 6:30pm on October 10th.",

Please read the information below and try to install the necessary software / packages ahead of time. Thanks!\n\nR packages:\nstringr\nDBI\nRSQLite\n\nDatabase software installed on the laptop:\nSQLite\nThis software is sometimes called SQLite and sometimes called SQLite3. For the sake of this demo, the difference does not matter at all.\n\nSQLite on a Mac:\nYour computer might have come with SQLite installed. Open up a Terminal window and type:\nwhich sqlite3\nIf you see something like /usr/bin/sqlite3, then you are all set. If it doesn’t say anything, then see the Homebrew instructions below.\n\nIf you do not have SQLite, you can install it with Homebrew:\nPoint your web browser at: brew.sh\nFollow the directions for installing Homebrew\nAt the command line, type: brew install sqlite\nIf that fails, try: brew install sqlite3\n\nAlso, the files for the tutorial are now available on GitHub at https://github.com/rladies-san-diego/2019_06_27_Amy_databases\n\nThanks!\n\nPS: We are meeting at the Salk Institute this month. The plan is to meet at the main gate at 6:30pm so we can go in together. If you arrive late, please let me know in the comments as the doors will be locked and I'll have to let you in. Thanks!",

    "description": "Hey all!\n\nOur fellow R enthusiasts from San Diego R Users Groups have invited us to join their upcoming meetup. I'm really excited to participate and get to know even more awesome R lovers!\n\nI hope to see you all there,\n\nJuliana\n\nPosted from San Diego R Users Groups:\n\nCoast to Coast for this summer meetup! July's meetup will feature 3 useR Groups!\n\nGreater Boston useR: https://www.meetup.com/Boston-useR/\nSan Diego useR: https://www.meetup.com/sd-r-users/\nSouth Coast MA useR: https://www.meetup.com/South-Coast-useR-Group\n\nTalk #1: Andrew Bates, Databases With R:\n\nUsing databases directly within R can greatly streamline your workflow. In this talk we will learn how to query databases and return the results as an R data frame. We will show how packages like DBI and dbplyr allow us to use dplyr syntax to run queries against a database and return the results. This allows us to keep our workflow entirely within R, instead of switching contexts between SQL and R. After looking at a few examples, we will cover some tips for incorporating these ideas into our daily work as well as resources for moving beyond the basics.\n\nTalk #2: Asmae Toumi, naniar package:\n\nAsmae Toumi will give a very broad overview of how to leverage the {naniar} package to explore and visualize missing data, identify patterns of missing data, and impute missing data using the {MICE} package.\n\nTalk #3: Amanda Hart, Tips & tricks for making your own R package:\n\nFrom plotting to analysis, packages are foundational tools for R users. But what happens when there isn’t an existing package to meet your needs? In this talk, we will learn how to take your own code and turn it into a new R package. We will provide simple steps to get started and tips to add features as you become package-building experts.\n\nTalk #4: Juliana Capitanio, Flexdashboards: Using interactive dashboards to create data visualizations\n\nJuliana Capitanio will show us how to use R Markdown to quickly create a dashboard using the flexdashboards package. These dashboards can compile plots, tables, gauges, value boxes, text annotations and maps into various layouts. Dashboard components are responsive and quickly resize to fit mobile devices. Further, we can easily make dashboard elements interactive by using htmlwidgets for R and/or Shiny.",

    "description": "Hey everyone,\n\nAs most of you know, UseR! 2020 is happening online this year. Further, this year the conference tutorials will be done in partnership with R-Ladies Global, MiR, and the AfricaR user group.\n\nThe AWESOME news is that our group, R-Ladies San Diego, has been chosen to host one of the UseR! tutorials this year! We are really excited to bring this opportunity to our members and to other R enthusiasts from all over the world!\n\nThe tutorial we are hosting will be presented by disk.frame creator Zhuo Jia Dai (ZJ). He'll tell us more about \"Easy Larger-than-RAM data manipulation with disk.frame\".\n\nHere's ZJ's description: In this tutorial, we will present the {disk.frame} (diskframe.com) R package for handling datasets that are too large for RAM but still fits comfortably on your hard drive. We will go through how {disk.frame} works, how to manipulate ten's of gigabytes of data without using all your RAM, and how you can take advantage of the many CPU cores on your computer by parallelizing data manipulation task using {disk.frame}. Also, I will show you how to perform all the standard data manipulations by using just dplyr verbs! After the tutorial, you should be able to confidently tackle dataset up to ten's of gigabytes in size comfortably on your laptop.\n\nI really hope you can all make it to our very first online event. This is such an amazing opportunity for all of us! Hopefully useR! 2020 will allow many that might not have been able to attend such a conference in person to join us in our exploration of the R universe.\n\nWe really look forward to (virtually) seeing everyone again soon!\n\nYour R-Ladies SD organizers",

It's pretty amazing how much we can learn with some very basic exploratory data analysis in R, from there, the sky is the limit.\n\nWe'll start with Elke giving us an example of how she did a really awesome project on small business in San Diego using data from California's Employment Development Department.\nIf we have time, Juliana will also give an example of how you can use natural language processing with freely available abstracts from scientific papers to learn a bunch of new sciency things!\n\nAfter that we'll divide into small groups to analyze other datasets or further explore one of the topics above.\nYou're welcome to use any dataset that interests you. Try google dataset search to see if anything out there sparks your curiosity. Kaggle also has loads of cool datasets available.\n\nWe'll end the evening sharing what the different groups have done.\n\nHope to see you all soon!\n\nYou can find links to the resources mentioned above below:\nCalifornia EDD Labor Market Information Resources and Data: https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/LMID/Size_of_Business_Data.html\nBiomedical natural language processing datasets and models: http://bio.nlplab.org/\nGoogle's dataset search: https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/\nKaggle datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets",

    "title": "Course: Modeling Normally Distributed Data with Repeated Measures",
    "description": "Hey R-Ladies SD members,\n\nThis short course is being hosted by OCRUG on Zoom and they have kindly invited us to participate.\n\nThere is a nominal cost, but they would like all to attend who want to. So there are a number of free tickets available. Just email john@jppeach.com for details.\n\nThe event details provided by OCRUG are as follows:\n\nRegistration is on Eventbrite (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ocrug-modeling-normally-distributed-data-with-repeated-measures-tickets-135236340535).\n\nAbstract\nThis workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.\n\nThe course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.\n\nWe would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be set up and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.\n\nThe material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [\"Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications\"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/), CRC Press, 2018.\n\nAbout the Instructor\nDr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). She received her Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 1996 from Wayne State University in Detroit, and a Ph.D. in Statistics from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 2002. Since then she has been teaching mostly Statistics courses in the Master's program in Applied Statistics at CSULB, and loving it!\n\nDr. Olga is an undergraduate advisor for students majoring in Mathematics with an option in Statistics. She is also the faculty supervisor for the Statistics Student Association. She is also the immediate past-president of the Southern California Chapter of the American Statistical Association (SCASA). Dr. Olga is the editor-in-chief of SCASA's monthly eNewsletter and the author (co-author) of four statistical books.\n\nSchedule\n\n• 06:30-06:40 Introduction\n• 06:40-07:30 Mixed-effects Model for Normal Response\n• 07:30-07:50 Mixed-effects Model Exercise\n• 07:50-08:00 Mixed-effects Model Solution\n• 08:00-08:10 Break\n• 08:10-08:30 Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) Model for Normal Response\n• 08:30-08:50 GEE Exercise\n• 08:50-09:00 GEE Solution\n• 09:00-09:30 Additional Exercise and Solution\n• 09:30-09:45 Wrap up\n\nWe hope to see you all there!\n\nYour R-Ladies SD organizers",

They holding an event that is sure to be a great educational event.\nOn October 1, they will have a workshop on advanced regression techniques. Dr. Olga gave this course a couple of years ago and it was a HUGE success. The sign-up is on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/socal-rug-advanced-regression-models-with-r-applications-tickets-407225381077).\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn a variety of regression models. We will give their definitions, discuss goodness-of-fit criteria, present fitted models, interpret estimated regression coefficients, and use the fitted models for prediction. The models will be limited to linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, gamma regression, ordinary logistic regression, Poisson regression, beta regression, longitudinal (repeated measures) regression, and hierarchical model.\n\nThe workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyze data and interpret results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).\n\nThe material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “[Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L1B143S/)”, CRC Press, 2018.\n\nFor more details and course content, check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression_2022-10-01).\n\nIf you have questions please reach out to [John@JPPeach.com](mailto:John@JPPeach.com).\nThere is a nominal fee for this event to help cover some of the costs, such as lunch. However, there is a limited number of tickets for those that the cost of the event will create a hardship. To apply for one of these tickets please reach out to [John@JPPeach.com](mailto:John@JPPeach.com) with a brief statement of your situation.",

    "description": "\\*\\*Signup on Eventbrite, not Meetup\\*\\*\n\\*\\*Signup on Eventbrite, not Meetup\\*\\*\n\nWe are excited to announce that SoCal RUG will be having an in-person data science hackathon! It is a weekend-long event from April 2nd to the 3rd, 2022.\n\\*\\*\\*\nYou can purchase tickets on Eventbrite.\n[https://tinyurl.com/hackathon-2022-04](https://tinyurl.com/hackathon-2022-04)\n\\*\\*\\*\nDuring this event, we will be exploring an interesting data set, starting from the raw data all the way through to a final \"end product\" (e.g. data visualization, interesting insight, analysis, and presentation.).\nThis event is open to all experience levels, from the complete beginner to the highly experienced. Participants will work in teams to \"hack\" through the data and will present their work at the end of the event for prizes. You are free to create your own team, or we will assist in team creation if you do not have one. This is a great way to network, share, and learn from others.\nThe main goal of the hackathon is to promote teamwork and foster education and learning in a welcoming environment. Though teams will be competing to present their best work at the end of the event for prizes, communication and providing assistance across teams is highly encouraged. We will provide in-person training during the hackathon and online training prior to the event.\nParticipants will need to bring their own computers during the event.\nWe have set up a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2022-04) that has more information about the event. Such as the schedule; setting up Slack and much more. Further information will be provided prior to the event.\nYour ticket includes meals, snacks and drinks during the event. Optionally, [parking at UCI](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2022-04/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) is $13 per day.\nAll participants must abide by the [SoCal RUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/socalrug/hackathon-2022-04/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [R Consortium Code of Conduct](https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct).\n\n## COVID-19 safety measures\n\nEvent will be indoors\nSafety measures instituted by event host. Meetup is not responsible for ensuring that precautions are followed.",
