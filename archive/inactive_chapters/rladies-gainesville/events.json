    "description": "Technology and the Data Revolution Discussion, led by Dr Morgan Ernest.\nDr Ernest is a professor at the University of Florida at Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. Her lab is part of the \"weecology\" group, an interdisciplinary ecology research group (https://www.weecology.org/).\nFor R-Ladies, she will lead a discussion on how different types of technology are changing the amount of data we have, how we collect it and the challenges these different data types present for analysis/management, etc. This promises to be an interesting discussion considering all our different backgrounds!\n\nIf time (and attendance) allows, we also want to do \"speed discussions\" in small groups, along the lines of speed dating. The idea is that within a set amount of time people talk to each other in small groups or one-on-one about their interests, how they use data and how they use R. When time is up, we change groups. We think this will be a fun way to get to know each other better, and learn more about what's possible in data science and R!\n\nNB We get a $0.50 discount on beers! Meeting will be in the Brick Room. As usual, opportunity to socialize afterwards, and kids are welcome!\nSorry - as far as we're aware there will not be a food truck that evening.",

We’ll discuss some of the issues that arise when someone else (or future you) tries to recreate statistical analyses and figures. Then, we’ll use two tools (RStudio and Docker) to create a reproducible data analysis. You are welcome to follow along with the reproducible data analysis tutorial even if you don’t have the following tools installed on your computer.\n\nPlease install (or update) these programs prior to the meet-up. We will be at the meet-up location 30 minutes early to troubleshoot installation issues.\n1. R\n2. RStudio\n3. Docker Desktop or Toolbox*\n\nInstallation guides\n\nR and RStudio installation guides from Data Carpentry can be found here: https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html#setup_instructions\nOpen the programs and check for errors.\n\nDocker Desktop installation guides from Cyverse can be found here (Section 2): https://github.com/sanjanasudarshan/container_camp_workshop_2019/blob/master/docker/dockerintro.rst\nTest the Docker installation by following Section 2.1.\n\n*Older versions of Mac and Windows may need to install Docker Toolbox instead of Docker Desktop:\nhttps://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/\nhttps://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/\n\nWhen you install Docker Desktop/Toolbox, you’ll create a Docker Hub username and password.

Reshma is the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code. In her popular TED Talk, she advocates for girls to learn coding as a way to practice failure and overcome expectations of “perfection”. Her book Brave, Not Perfect expands on these ideas by describing how society promotes perfection, why we should be learning to be brave instead, and how to achieve this goal.\n\nWhere to get the book:\nAlachua county library has a couple copies\nUsed and ebooks start at around $12\nFree audiobook with an Audible trial through Amazon\nWe’ve created a book swap here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X36YPE4NVvW9JTZp6AxbAhlsfxra8ntdBsZIllkNC2Q/edit#gid=0\n\nNot able to read the book? Here are some alternatives:\nWatch the TED Talk: https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection?language=en\n\nRead one of the many book reviews\nJust read the questions below and come with some ideas!\n\nDiscussion questions to get us started:\n1. How does the goal of perfection operate as a barrier in your life?\n2. Coding is a great tool for practicing failure. What are some other tools you currently or could use?\n3. What are some good examples of bravery that you’ve seen in your field or career?",

A brief introduction to basic package structure coupled with some hands-on exercises and examples will lay the foundation for your package-building journey. Start small with a package for your data analysis, dream big. No prior experience with building R packages is necessary (actually, this is very intro level so if you've built a package before you probably know this). Basic familiarity with R language is helpful.",

You can think of these meetups as an accountability tool rather than a class. Each meeting, R-Ladies Gainesville will provide an additional challenge to inspire you in your data visualization. This week's challenge is to use this maize color palette: https://github.com/AndiKur4/MaizePal\n\nPrior to the Meetup, please make sure you have R downloaded on your computer (https://mirrors.nics.utk.edu/cran/).
