    "description": "* Updated Location * Please note that we will be meeting at Hemoshear, not VividCortex. Hemoshear is located near the other end of the Downtown Mall at 501 Locust Avenue, Suite 301. There is free parking in the parking lot.\n\nPipes, plots, and more!\n\nJoin us for a two-part workshop led by UVA's Marieke Jones on two core packages in the tidyverse: dplyr and ggplot2. This session is geared towards all proficiency levels in R. Whether you've just started learning and you want to know what piping is or how to make a plot, or if you're a pro and you want a refresher on writing cleaner code, this workshop will be beneficial to you. Also, there will be pizza :)\n\nSchedule:\n\n• 6:00-6:45 Intro to R\n\n• 6:45-7:30 Intro to dplyr\n\nCome to one or both!\n\nPlease bring a laptop with R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package installed before coming to the MeetUp. If you need a short tutorial on getting oriented in R and on installing a package in R, please see this YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTTJPRwnONE). We will be available 30min before the session starts to assist anyone with troubles installing R, RStudio, or packages.\n\nPlease download the nhanes.csv (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipUu6PPQJcX_QwMNWVwG2KJBWju5smrHMd9jcJwb64U/edit?usp=sharing) dataset we will be using during the sessions. Save this file to your Desktop so you can easily find it.\n\nFollow us on twitter for more updates! @RLadiesCville\n\nSee you then!",

Of course, there will also be snacks. :)\n\nHow do I participate?\n\nWe're going to kick off the book club by working through the first section of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (available for FREE at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html). We'll start with Data Visualization with ggplot2, and we'll cover a new section, or chapter, every two weeks.\n\nIn each Meetup, we'll work through the exploratory problems, discuss questions that come up in each section, and apply the concepts to real life examples. You should walk away from this experience with a solid grounding in the basics of R tidyverse principles.\n\nWhile it is recommended that everyone read the week's section prior to the Meetup, you should go through the book at a pace you are comfortable with.

Lightning talks can be about absolutely anything. The art and practice of crafting these talks is great because it forces you to work on:\n\n• Choosing a topic that you are passionate about enough to share AND realizing that you do have something interesting to say.\n\n• Realizing that questions and challenges can be a good thing - you don't have to know all the answers!\n\n• Developing clear and effective presentation design & fine tuning your verbal presentation skills.\n\nAt this Meetup, we'll cover what a lightning talk is and we'll brainstorm some ways to develop them. We will also discuss how to best format presentations in R, because this is, after all, an R-Ladies Meetup. :)\n\nNo need to come with an idea in mind, however if you would like to rehearse a lightning talk that you have been working on, we are an eager audience.\n\nOf course, there will be pizza.\n\nSee you all then!",

    "description": "Dashboards are a great, user-friendly way for communicating insights and sharing results. They offer more flexibility than standard reports, and with R and Shiny they can be interactive and deliver complex results.\n\nBut where do you start? For many, grokking a Shiny app is no easy feat. This is where flexdashboard is incredibly valuable - all it needs is a little R code, mixed with some R Markdown, and voila! Flexdashboard also integrates with Shiny, so it's a great on ramp to learning more about reactivity.\n\nThis hands-on virtual workshop will give an overview of building dashboards, starting with RMarkdown and flexdashboard, and will end with some more advanced topics such as Shiny and HTML widgets.\n\nAll are welcome, and no Shiny experience is needed.\n\nDashboard: https://connect.rstudioservices.com/penguins/\n\nSlides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16JtzkVJc2iLoFB_RmtgPhfJwpP0jh0iPOj9Ch4f48vE/edit?usp=sharing\n\nRStudio Cloud Project: https://rstudio.cloud/project/1389836\n\nGithub repo: https://github.com/SamanthaToet/intro-to-flexdashboard",
