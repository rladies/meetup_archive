    "description": "• What we'll do\nMine Dogucu will be here from out of town and will be our guest speaker! She'll give a talk on Handling Missing Values with R. Whether you are an experienced R user or are just getting started, we invite you to come out!\n\nBio: Mine Dogucu completed her PhD at the Ohio State University. During her graduate studies she founded R Ladies Columbus. In August 2017, she joined the Data Science Program at New College of Florida as Assistant Professor of Applied Statistics. She has been teaching statistics courses both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. She also has founded R Ladies Sarasota.\n\nTalk Abstract: It is common for data scientists and researchers to encounter missing data. The term “missing” often has a bad connotation and is usually considered a nuisance. Advances in missing data treatments such as multiple imputation and maximum likelihood procedures allow data analysts to obtain unbiased parameter estimates under certain circumstances. This talk will introduce missing data terminology and ways of handling missing data using R.\n\n• What to bring\n\n• Important to know",

It is intended to be a continuation of Laura's talk on Design Thinking back in June.\n\n‘Design sprint’ is a methodological process which is primarily based on design thinking (a principle founded by a former Googler, Jake Knapp) , it helps you to see beyond the problem and you learn to solve the problems in the most efficient way within a specific time range. It is applicable to anyone in the Data Science/Tech community. The main focus will be more on cultivating mindset and skills rather than on tools.\n\nThis workshop will be based on the book \"Sprint\" by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, et al. (https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas/dp/150112174X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=sprint&qid=1565275020&s=gateway&sr=8-1)\n\nThis workshop is not exclusive to those in the R community. Anyone is the tech,data science community, or just want to learn about a new approach to solving problems is welcome to join! Lunch will be provided. :)\n\nParking:\nCultural Center Garage:\n50 NW 2nd Ave.\nMiami, FL 33126\n\n$5 flat rate with validation inside the library!",

However, these methodologies can be improved upon. This presentation proposes a hybrid methodology for combining elements from qualitative research (such as personas) in order to improve statistical analysis and provide a deeper understanding into problem setting, using example scenarios from the financial industry.\n\nIn this talk we will ...\n- Reflect on the current standardized methodologies used for quantitative research methods (aka statistics/data science) like CRISP / KDD and how they perform in real life\n- Analyze how to embed elements from qualitative research methods to enhance the data science process\n- Set the seed for the need of a new methodology\n- Open up for ideas/questions\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nLaura Gabrysiak is a Data Scientist at Visa where she develops statistical models and user-friendly decision analytics tools to help customers get the most out of their data.

We'll have Kimoy Kotun teach us some data wrangling techniques using the data.table and dplyr packages.\n\nKimoy currently works as a Data Specialist at Spirit Airlines. She holds hold an undergraduate and Masters degree in Mathematics. Kimoy started her career in the Revenue Management Group at Spirit and, within the last year and a half, developed a keen interest in the Data Science space as she saw this as an opportunity to hone in and grow her statistical expertise and programming skills. She is a self-taught R user and now uses R on a daily basis in my current role, primarily for reporting and data analysis. Kimoy enjoy reading and learning more about Data Science as it is a constantly evolving field.\n\nWe looking forward to seeing you there!",

Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, treeheatr can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students’ understanding of a simple decision tree model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods.\n\nTrang is a postdoctoral fellow with Jason Moore at the Computational Genetics Lab, University of Pennsylvania. She enjoys developing machine learning methods for analyses of biomedical data, including neuroimage (functional/structural MRI), transcriptomics and genotypes. Most of the datasets she works with are high dimensional (i.e., have many predictors/features), so she spends most of her time building feature selection algorithms for these data. She trades her bias toward the nearest-neighbor concept for lower variance of her methods and better generalizability. When she is not knee deep in data, she runs, dance and seasonally skis.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~MATERIALS~~~~~~~~~\nslides: https://slides.com/trang1618/treeheatr-pmlbr\nmaterial doc: https://slides.com/trang1618/treeheatr-pmlbr",

    "description": "R-Ladies Miami is excited to present Max Kuhn on March 3, 2020!\n\nMany machine learning models have hyperparameters whose values cannot be analytically estimated from the data. For example, the number of neighbors in a nearest-neighbor classification model. The tidymodels collection or R packages are a tidyverse interface to modeling. In this talk, the new tune package will be introduced. Examples of the tidy interface to model tuning will be demonstrated.\n\nMax Kuhn is a software engineer at RStudio. He is currently working on improving R's modeling capabilities. He was a Senior Director of Nonclinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D in Connecticut. He was applying models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 18 years. Max has a Ph.D. in Biostatistics.\n\nMax is the author of numerous R packages for techniques in machine learning and reproducible research and is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Statistical Software. He, and Kjell Johnson, wrote the book Applied Predictive Modeling, which won the Ziegel award from the American Statistical Association, which recognizes the best book reviewed in Technometrics in 2015.

    "description": "Register here: https://info.datascience.salon/ai-inference-workloads-solving-challenges-beyond-training-models\n\nIn recent years, enterprise AI initiatives have made great strides in solving the challenges of training massive, distributed computational models. Data wrangling, experimentation management, GPU resource allocation…these challenges have spawned an ever-growing market of new tools and considerable investment. But despite all this, the ability to productize AI is still stunted in most enterprises.\n\nIn our survey of more than 200 data scientists and MLOps/IT experts, a majority of AI/ML models still aren’t making it to production. AI/ML teams are now under pressure to optimize and manage AI inference workloads in production and deliver a return on investment.\n\nIn this webinar, we will walk through the distinct characteristics of each stage in the ML lifecycle and their computational requirements. We’ll discuss solutions to improve throughput and reduce latency, and finally, we’ll show how one organization built an efficient inference platform on top of Kubernetes to support their scaling AI initiatives.\n\n“Rapid AI development is what this is all about for us. What Run:AI helps us do is to move from a company doing pure research, to a company with results in production.”\n\nSiddharth Sharma, Sr. Research Engineer, Wayve\n\nRegister here: https://info.datascience.salon/ai-inference-workloads-solving-challenges-beyond-training-models",

This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling.
