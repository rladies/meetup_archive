Then this meeting is for you!\n\nMeeting agenda:\n\n- We will start off the meeting with introductions of everyone in attendance.\n\n- Once everyone gets settled, we will move on to a short, interactive presentation on how to use ggplot2, including tips from experienced users.\n\n- There will be plenty of time for questions, so feel free to bring any questions about data visualization or any other R projects you are working on.\n\n- If there is interest, we can also go through an \"Introduction to R\" presentation for newer users.\n\nWe will be meeting in the Biostatistics Department computer lab, located on the third floor of the College of Public Health Building. Once you get to the third floor, look for the \"Department of Biostatistics\" sign. The computer lab is located just inside the department, to the left.\n\nWe will try to send out some materials beforehand so stay tuned!\nUPDATE: https://areisett.github.io/ggplot2_tutorial/index.html\n\nHope to see you there!\nAlex",
