    "description": "Dear All,\n\nPlease join us for the very first meetup of the R-Ladies Cape Town chapter. R-Ladies is a worldwide organisation whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. There are many other R-Ladies chapters in cities all around the world. As an organization R-Ladies is fully inclusive of trans women, genderqueer women and non-binary people who are significantly female-identified, and the same stands for R-Ladies Cape Town. Please have a look at the R-Ladies rules and guidelines. (https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/blob/master/R-Ladies_RulesGuidelines.pdf)\n\nThe idea for the Cape Town chapter of R-Ladies Global is to bring together women who work with R to get to know, support and learn from each other. The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of women in every role and area of participation. You absolutely do not need to be good at R to be a part of this community.\n\nHere is a map link (http://tinyurl.com/y8csajg2) to the venue for the meetup. We are very happy that it is so close to public transport for people who rely on it. I know we will be meeting outside peak hours. If you have any safety concerns regarding getting to the station or getting home, please get in touch and we will find out if anyone with a car is going your way and can lift you.\n\nThere will be some drinks and snacks to fuel the conversation. We will say a few words to kick off but otherwise please just come along, be brave and chat to people :)\n\nWe really hope to see you there. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.\n\nAll the best,\n\nTheoni, Megan and Wiebke",

These maps can then be used as layers within the ggplot2 plotting system. Essentially, you can plot maps from ggmap, and then use ggplot2 to plot points and other geoms on top of the map. Using ggplot+ggmap this way is extremely useful for geospatial visualization.\n\nHave a look at this blog post as a quick introduction: https://blog.dominodatalab.com/geographic-visualization-with-rs-ggmaps/\n\nThis is a really useful skill to have in in your toolbox for all sorts of use cases, so come join us!\n\n** Preparation\nAs this will be a hands on session (please bring your laptop, if you have one) and also install the following beforehand, if possible:\n- tidyverse\n- ggmap\n\n** The header image comes from this post on stackoverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11201997/world-map-with-ggmap",

We will put on some drinks and finish off the evening with some time to chat to our special out-of-town guests :)\n\nWe will meet in a smaller meeting room on the 3rd floor of the Bandwidth Barn, I'll find out it's name and put it up soon.\n\nI hope to see many of you there!

The #tidytuesday initiative was created by R for Data Science (#R4DS) - they release a data set every Tuesday with the challenge to create a unique visualisation based on the data set. We will be doing just that! Bring along your laptop - we will be downloading the #tidytuesday data set released that day (or you could use a previous one if you like) and using it to practice our visualisation skills. We will provide a short script to get you started. You are welcome to work on your own or collaborate, and bring your own data and questions along if you'd like. If you can, please bring something to drink and/or some snacks to share!\n\nFrom R4DS: \"Join the R4DS online learning community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!”\n\nWe encourage a mix of regular useRs and total beginners to encourage a collaborative co-learning space. Follow #tidytuesday on Twitter for some examples of visualisations created in the past. If you feel up to it, we encourage posting your own visualisation :)",

    "description": "Join us for two talks showcasing some of the applications of what you can do with R!\n\n### Amieroh Abrahams: \"Detecting marine heatwaves (MHWs) by using R-programming\"\n\nOver the past three decades, anthropologically mediated warming has negatively affected marine and terrestrial ecosystems. This has ultimately resulted in major consequences for humanity and natural ecological functioning. Climate change is generally understood as the long-term rise in global mean surface temperatures. Recent studies have shown an increase in the frequency of extreme events. Extreme warming events such as marine heatwaves (MHW) are defined as a discrete prolonged anomalously warm water event. Here I will demonstrate the various R packages produced and utilized by South African scientists (heatwaveR and RmarineHeatWaves) to detect these extreme events.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Megan Beckett: \"Exploring the South African School Directory with R\"\n\nSouth Africa has an incredibly diverse, expansive education system, with over *25 000* schools dotted across the country, ranging from dilapidated mud huts and blackboards underneath trees to state-of-the-art, high tech facilities.\n\nI wanted to see how I could add value by taking some seemingly forgotten Excel files from the Department of Basic Education website, and providing a visual map to explore, understand and appreciate the diversity and complexity of our education system.\n\nI’ll show how I used *OpenStreetMaps* to help geocode missing data for school locations, and then used *Shiny* and *Leaflet* to create an app which allows anybody to visually explore, understand and locate schools across our country, without having to delve into those enormous Excel files.\n\nBy the end, not only will you get an idea of how easy it is to turn legacy geospatial data into something visual, interactive and informative, but you’ll also have a unique perspective into the challenges posed by South Africa’s multifarious, multilayered, multicultural and multicoloured education system.",

She has been collecting GPS tracking data from Verreaux’s eagles across South Africa and is building an R-based model to predict wind turbine collision risk for the species. The model functions in a similar way to habitat use models and will help to inform macro- and micro- placement of wind turbines across SA in more eagle-friendly locations.\n\nThe session will present what a wind turbine collision risk model is and why we need it. Then Meg will share some R code to analyse some tracking data and use it for predictive modeling. This will include annotating tracking data with topographic data, preparing it for a model and using the model to make predictions about collision risk in other areas.\n\nBring laptops and have the ‘raster’ package installed.\n\nFind out more information here: https://blackeagleproject.blogspot.com/p/about-black-eagle-project.html",

Luckily R has your back and teaching yourself new skills is something you can achieve from the comfort of your couch.

Locally the national policy on prevention and response to GBV hopes to achieve 25 % Prevalence in the next year.\nThis presentation will look at reporting GBV prevalence in Kenya while highlighting notable trends in counties.\nThe aim of this project is to further look at how far the country is at achieving 25% Prevalence goal set by the national policy.\" - Caroline Akoth\n\nAfter witnessing her informative, moving and empowering talk at satRday2020 in Joburg, we are thrilled to have her back to share her work with our members.

    "description": "Please join us for our first online Cape Town R-Ladies meetup!\n\nWe will be going through an \"Introduction to Shiny\" with Taryn Morris from Ixio Analytics.\n\nShiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards.\n\nThis year has been quite a ride so far and we haven't yet had a physical meetup, despite our attempts to organise one! We are still working out the details and will post the link to join the Meetup online on Thursday.\n\nPlease do join us for an hour from the comfort of your homes and connect again with the RLadies community in Cape Town, and beyond!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://zoom.us/j/95014443709?pwd=d2ZjYUkxMlpjQ0xwd2dydjdSbnFjUT09\n\nMeeting ID: 950 1444 3709\nPassword: 790655",
