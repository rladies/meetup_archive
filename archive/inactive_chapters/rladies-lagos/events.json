    "description": "# The Challenge\n\nGaps in healthcare still exist and the need for better solutions to bridge those gaps is critical. Today, more than half of the world’s population lives one to two hours away from a doctor. The pandemic taught us that telehealth can be a great option. It allows patients and doctors to maintain routine contact and, therefore, good health—but only if the right tools are available. The challenge faced by health providers is how to incorporate new technologies that enable doctors and patients to have real conversations, supported by a simple experience.\n\n### This is where you come in.\n\nDevelopers are out-of-the-box thinkers, so we need your help to improve the flow of information between patients and doctors and identify ways to provide better patient support, regardless of their location.\n\n### Tech Stack\n\n* Teams may use any tech stack of their preference\n* The tech stack should include a combination of cloud technologies, data & analytics, and artificial intelligence\n* OpenText cloud APIs MUST be a key component of your solution\n\n***\n\n**Thank you for participating! We invite you to participate in one or all of the challenges identified. If you would like to combine multiple challenges into a super solution, submissions will be accepted and will be judged based on the use cases.**\n\n### Task\n\n* Develop a solution using OpenText API's\n* Deployment of project on Github or Postman\n\n***\n\n### Submission format\n\n* Project description (mandatory)\n* Presentation (mandatory – can be either a video or document)\n* Link to the project",
