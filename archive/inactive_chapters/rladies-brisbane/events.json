There is a need to run multiple variants of a 'job', that is, some R script you send to a (perhaps high performance) computer with input variables. Katie will discuss her general approach to modularised coding, sending jobs to a HPC and then analyzing results.\n\n*Who is going to present:\nKatie is a PhD candidate at Queensland University of Technology (QUT). She is working on Bayesian Adaptive design in river networks, which is an optimisation framework. In the context of water quality monitoring, we use this optimization algorithm to find where, when and how many sensors to deploy across the network. Katie completed her Bachelor of Advanced Mathematics from the University of Wollongong (UOW) and worked in the financial industry for a number of years before undertaking PhD studies.\n\n* When are we meeting?\nThe talk will start at 5:00 pm for a ~45 minute presentation, 15 minutes Q&A time with the potential to move to an outside venue for continued socializing and networking.\n\n* Where are we meeting?\nWe will meet at QUT Gardens Point campus room Y-801 (in building Y) - this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.\nmap: https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6\nDIRECTIONS TO THE ROOM - Y block/building is next to River Stage in QUT Gardens Point.

    "title": "Introduction to using Docker for reproducibility in R",
    "description": "*What are we going to learn:\nDocker is a platform for creating “containers” on your system. You can think of them like a mini system on your computer. They are completely self-contained, isolated environments on your system. These containers include their own operating system, application software, scripts, data, etc. Containers are useful for a lot of things, but here I’ll focus on a quick introduction to using Docker for reproducibility in R. I will demonstrate on how to set-up Docker, run R on a Docker container and few other use cases.\n\n*Who is going to present:\nMalindrie is a PhD candidate at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland. She works on developing bioinformatics methods for the analysis of large-scale single-cell data using advanced statistical modelling and uses modern statistics tools to understand human disease. Malindrie completed her Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Statistics in 2016.\n\n* When are we meeting?\nThe talk will start at 5:00 pm for approximately 45 mins and 15 min Q&A. After that we invite you to stay for in-person and/or virtual catch up.\n\n************The presentation will start at 5:00 pm********************\n* Where are we meeting?\nWe will meet at study room 01-W227, Law Library (Walter Harrison Library), UQ St. Lucia campus- this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.\nmap: https://goo.gl/maps/5AmevJ4dqiDUtkEn7\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\n\nR-Ladies Brisbane\n\n********************************************************************************\nPhotos, Films and all other media/recordings: Photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

    "title": "Modelling workflows in R and the R-INLA package - Hybrid(In-person or Zoom)",
    "description": "*What are we going to learn:\nDo you use statistical models in R or want to learn? Learn how to best structure your model workflows including reading in data, checking the data, performing analyses, and plotting. The presentation will also go into more advanced topics discussing the R-INLA package for modelling spatio-temporal data. R-INLA is a powerful method that uses integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to create complex models with various types of random effects such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation and run them very fast (https://www.r-inla.org/home). In this talk, we will specially focus on how to model spatial autocorrelation using coral recovery data. Best for those who are comfortable with R but all are welcome.\n\n*Who is going to present:\nDr. Julie Vercelloni is a quantitative ecologist that studied Marine Ecology during her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and statistics applied to coral reef ecology for her PhD. She is now an Associate Investigator at the Queensland University of Technology node of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers and works mostly with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\nJulie is doing research on diverse projects that look at combining state-of-the-art technologies including machine learning and virtual reality, and modern statistical modelling methods to help understanding complex problems related to coral reef conservation. She is also a citizen science advocate, working on new types of monitoring for the Great Barrier Reef and Pacific countries.\n\n* When are we meeting?\nThe talk will start at 5:30 pm for a ~45 minute presentation, 15 minutes Q&A time with the potential to move to an outside venue for continued socializing and networking.\n\n* Where are we meeting?\nWe will meet at QUT Gardens Point campus room Y-801 (in building Y) - this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.\nmap: https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6\nDIRECTIONS TO THE ROOM - Y block/building is next to River Stage in QUT Gardens Point.

Through gameplay one can easily explore complex ideas, like the interactive roles of quarantining and testing. No Shiny will be assumed, so the talk will be accessible to all levels and should be fun. We'll talk about the basics of coding reactive variables and how this relates to coding rules for a game.\n\n*Who is going to present?\n\nKate Saunders is a lecturer in the School of Mathematical Sciences whose research interests are in statistical climatology. Her primary focus is on modelling climate extremes; and understanding how the probability of extreme events might be influenced by climate change. She also has a keen interest in data visualisation and R programming. An interest which helps her succeed in her research.\n\n* When are we meeting?\n\n***********The presentation will start at 5:00 pm (AEST)********************\n\nThe presentation will run for 45 minutes with 15 minutes for questions/mingling.\n\n* Where are we meeting?\nThis talk will be held via Zoom\n\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\n\nR-Ladies Brisbane\n\n********************************************************************************\nPhotos, Films and all other media/recordings: Photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences. You can find her online at her blog and YouTube.\n\nTopic:\n\nWhile data scientists are often taught about training a machine learning model, building an MLOps strategy to deploy and maintain that model can be daunting. In this talk, learn about MLOps concepts like model deployment and model drift, the different ways the word “performance” is used with models, what you can monitor about a model, how feedback loops impact models, and how you can set yourself up for success with model maintenance. This talk will help practitioners who are already deploying models, but this is also useful knowledge for data science practitioners earlier in their MLOps journey; decisions made along the way can make the difference between resilient models that are easier to maintain and disappointing or misleading models.",
