Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Brisbane is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. <\/em><\/p><p><em>Full community guidelines are found here: <\/em><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki\" target=\"_blank\"><em>https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki<\/em><\/a><em> <\/em><\/p><p><br /><\/p><p><em>Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: <\/em><\/p><p><em>Photos, Films, and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Brisbane event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
