    "description": "👩‍💻✨ Welcome to our first **R-Ladies Session**! We’re thrilled to have you join us for this journey into the world of R and data analysis.\n**Who We Are**\nR-Ladies is a global organization that promotes gender diversity in the R community, providing an inclusive, supportive space for women and gender minorities interested in data science, programming, and data-driven storytelling. Whether you’re a seasoned R user or just curious, you’re in the right place!\n**What We’ll Cover Today**\nWe'll start with a quick intro to R, covering the basics so that you feel comfortable working in the environment. Then, we’ll dip our toes into **dplyr**, one of the most popular packages in R for data manipulation, using the classic `iris` dataset. Don’t worry if this is all new; by the end of today’s session, you'll have a toolkit to start exploring data with confidence.\n**Session Outline**\n\n1. **Introduction to R**: Setting up, basic commands, and understanding the console.\n2. **The `iris` Dataset**: A quick look at our data, and why this is such a popular dataset for learning.\n3. **Introduction to `dplyr`**: Learn how to filter, select, arrange, and summarize data using simple, readable code.\n\n**What to Expect**\nThis session will be interactive! Feel free to ask questions, share your screen, and explore along with us. R is as much about experimentation as it is about coding—don’t be afraid to make mistakes.\nLet’s dive in and have some fun! 🌈",
