    "description": "Writing R package documentation with Roxygen2\n\nOne of the most important aspect when developing an R package is writing the documentation. A good documentation will help people to use your package, yourself (to remember what you were thinking at that moment) and other developers interested in your work.\nR provides a standard way to write .Rd files into the man/ directory. In this talk we are going to present how Roxygen2 can help us to write Rd files directly from source file. We are going to discuss its particular syntax and the advantages over writing .Rd files by hand.\n\nby Marlene Marchena\n\nStructural Equation Modelling. When do you need it and what does Lavaan package offer?\n\nThis short talk aims to give you an overview of the applications of structural equation modelling (SEM) across different fields. We will start with talking about some examples so that you get a sense of what SEM is about, and where you can (or should) apply SEM models. We will very briefly touch upon issues such as latent variable modelling, measurement invariance, formative and reflective models and so on. I will come up with a selection, but we can improvise based on what the participants are most interested in. Then, I plan to quickly run a few examples with the Lavaan package in R.\n\nby Ahu Alanya\n\nDoors will open at 6:40 PM\n\nTalks will start around 7:00 PM",
