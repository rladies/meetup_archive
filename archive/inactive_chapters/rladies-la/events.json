    "description": "Hi Los Angeles R Ladies!\n\nWe'll be having our next meetup on November 19th at 1pm on campus at UCLA. At our last meeting everyone was enthusiastic about writing an R package together! The more experienced group members can take the lead on the coding while we all learn and work along together.\n\nTo narrow our focus, we would like to analyze a dataset from the city of LA made public at data.lacity.org.\n\nFor November we should focus on picking a dataset and a general question. So browse through the open datasets and brainstorm a few ideas. At our meetup we can take turns describing particularly interesting data sets and at the end we'll vote on the choice for our package.\n\nWe'll make all of the code public as we go and hopefully end up with a fun package at the end.\n\nSee you there!\nKatie\nkatie@rladies.org\n\nLocation details:\nWe'll be in room 325 in the Botany building. If you enter from Charles E Young Drive South, 325 is the first room on the left (the entrance is on the third floor). We'll prop the door open, but if it happens to be locked, just send a tweet to @RLadiesLA and we'll let you in.\nThe closest visitor parking is parking structure 2 and it is $3 per hour. There is also street parking on Hilgard Ave and the surrounding neighborhood. https://main.transportation.ucla.edu/campus-parking/visitors/pay-station-rates-and-locations",

    "description": "RLadies Los Angeles and LA Women Who Code are excited to present\n\nCollaborative Data Science with Kaggle Kernels and Datasets\n\nby Megan Risdal\n\nCode and data sharing in collaboration with others is integral to open data science. On Kaggle, the world’s largest online data science community, users use Kernels as a platform to share and execute reproducible code and Datasets to access, analyze, and maintain public data projects. Since the introduction of Kernels in 2015, users have written tens of thousand of kernels in R, Python, and Julia. And in the past year, users and organizations have published over 2,000 public datasets. Over this time, Kernels and Datasets have transformed how the data science community tackles machine learning problems, collaborates, and learns. In this talk, Megan Risdal uses community metrics and insights to share what Kernels and Datasets have taught Kaggle about collaborative data science.\n\nMegan (https://twitter.com/MeganRisdal) is a Community Advocate and Data Scientist at Kaggle. She holds master’s degrees in linguistics from UCLA and North Carolina State University.\n\nWhere: Google Venice (https://www.google.com/maps/place/400+Hampton+Dr,+Venice,+CA+90291/@33.9954407,-118.4757689,20z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2bacf14e5fcb9:0x325955854edc3b52!8m2!3d33.9955779!4d-118.4760707), 400 Hampton Drive, Venice 90291\n\n(Note: Enter through the gate on Sunset here: https://goo.gl/QwgtQf ).\n\nWhen: Tuesday October 17th, 2017\n\n6.00: Doors open, food and drinks served.\n\n7.00: Talk start.\n\n8.00: Talk end.\n\nUnfortunately parking will not be provided, but there are public parking lots close by.\n\nFood and drinks will be provided.\n\nBring photo ID - we cannot admit without it.

Each book club session will have a leader to guide the discussion, and we encourage everyone to take a look at the material beforehand. The full text of the book is online for free at https://adv-r.hadley.nz/, and there's an exercise answer guide at https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/.\n\nHere’s the schedule:\n• Foundations - August 3, session leader was Amanda Tilot\n• Functional Programming - August 10, session leader was Amy Tzu-Yu Chen\n• OO Programming - split over August 24 (Base Types, S3, and R6) and September 7 (S4 and Trade-offs), session leader was Daniel Jacobs\n• Metaprogramming - split over September 21 (Ch 17, 18, 19) and October 5 (Ch 20, 21), session leader will be Emil Hvitfeldt!\n• **Techniques - split over October 19 (Ch 22, 23) and November 9 (Ch 24, 25), session leaders will be Jake Kramer and Malcolm Barrett respectively!**\n\nAdvanced R dives deep into how R works as a language, and we highly recommend joining us for the first two sessions if you’re relatively new to R.

    "title": "Reducing Bias in Algorithms! R-Ladies January meetup",
    "description": "Hi Los Angeles R-Ladies!\n\nWe'll be having our next meetup on January 26th at 10am (note earlier time!) on campus at UCLA. In addition to an earlier time, we'll also be in a different location! However, it is very close to the previous one.\n\nWe’ll be welcoming a guest speaker, RLady Gwynn Sturdevant, to talk about reducing bias in algorithms. This talk will give some examples of algorithms that are biased and the consequences that ensue. Unfortunately, developing equitable algorithms is mathematically complex, and there is no simple way to do so. We will discuss two suggested methods and their drawbacks and conclude with a discussion of ethical matrices.\n\nAs always we welcome people regardless of gender, but our group is intended for those who identify with a gender minority (trans women, cis women, trans men, non-binary, other). We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.\n\nSee you there!\nKatie Leap\nkleap@ucla.edu\n\nLocation details:\nWe'll be in room 113 of Geffen Hall, located at the corner of Le Conte Ave and Tiverton Dr, across the street from Ralph's.\nThe closest visitor parking is parking structure 18 (and it is much closer than parking structure 2 is to our regular meeting spot) and it is $3 per hour. There is also street parking on Hilgard Ave and the surrounding neighborhood. https://main.transportation.ucla.edu/campus-parking/visitors/pay-station-rates-and-locations",

You can build them in R with RMarkdown! In this tutorial, we'll work through some common scenarios where RMarkdown can help improve your data communication and organization.\n\n* Shifting from R script files + lots of #comments to RMarkdown notebooks\n* Turning your R code into HTML, PDFs, and Word docs with knitr\n* Enhancing your RMarkdown files with text formatting and presentation options\n* Doing more with code chunks: SQL queries & background jobs\n\n**Schedule**\n10:00a - 10:15a Open Zoom, come say hi!\n10:15a - 11:00 RMarkdown tutorial\n11:00 - 11:15 Extra Q&A, planning future sessions\n\nHave a question about using RMarkdown that you'd like Amanda to cover?
