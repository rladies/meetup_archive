    "description": "** REGISTER AT EMORY LINK BELOW **\n** DO NOT RSVP HERE AT R-LADIES **\n\n================================\nEmory University Rollins School of Public Health Biostatistics Department & Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing; Georgia Chapter of the ASA and R-Ladies of Atlanta are Excited to Sponsor:\n\nLiving a Reproducible Life\nGUEST SPEAKER: Hadley Wickham\nChief Scientist RStudio\n\nOctober 16, 2018: 4:00 – 5:30 pm\nEmory University\n1440 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30322\nWoodruff Health Sciences Center Administration Building (WHSCAB) Auditorium\n\nBIO: Hadley Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio. He is interested in building tools (computational and cognitive) that make data ingest, preparation, manipulation, visualization and analysis easier. He's developed over 30 R packages, for data analysis (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr), making frustrating parts of R easier to use (lubridate for dates, stringr for strings, httr for accessing web APIs), and for streamlining the R package development (devtools, roxygen2, and testthat).\n\nSUMMARY: Dr. Wickham will discuss the benefits for reproducibility on the small scale (e.g. a single scientific paper) which are clear: anything that can be reified and made explicit in code, should be made explicit in code. In this talk, he'll discuss how reproducibility has escaped journal articles in his life and influences almost everything he does. He'll discuss three unexpected venues of reproducibility in his life:\n\n1. “Writing reproducible books with bookdown, which allows me to generate html, pdf, and epub versions of the text with a press of a key.”\n2. “Writing reproducible blog posts with blogdown, which makes easy to intermingle code and prose in low-stakes explanations of my work.”\n3. “Generating reproducible emails to track shared water usage and inform my neighbours when they owe me money!”\n\nHe'll also touch on the intersection of reproducibility and software development, highlighting best practices like unit testing, code coverage, and continuous integration.\n\nDirections/Parking: see details at https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/HadleyWickham_Oct2018/\n\nREGISTER AT THIS LINK ONLY https://eventactions.com/eareg.aspx?ea=Rsvp&invite=gwump82y45b2ccrggusxhyp5gcm5v88cn8hdhgkyc4wd1e7whw45",

    "description": "R Ladies of Atlanta, get ready for our second event and it will be an exciting one!\nWe have the honor of bringing in guest speaker, Rob Stilson who will be introducing us to data wrangling with R.\n\nAt this meetup, you will learn about data wrangling in R via the tidyverse (specifically dplyr) where you will explore the various verbs (slice, select, filter, mutate, etc.) in order to get data into a specific format. Additionally, we will briefly touch on exporting the resulting data frames and tables in to a multi-tab Excel format.\n\nPlease bring a charged laptop and make sure you have R and RStudio downloaded ready to go.\n\nTo download R: https://cloud.r-project.org\n\nTo download RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/download\n\nFollow the instructions to download and install.\n\nAll R proficiency levels are welcome!\n\nPlease check-in via the Guest Registration Tablet at the Front Desk and select my name \"Emilie Seena\" as your host. Also, please bring a photo ID.\n\nWework do not offer validation for parking but feel free to park in the Tower Place 100 garage, located on Tower Place Drive, just across from the Doubletree Hotel. Once you’ve parked, you’ll want to exit the garage using same front entrance you drove into. The tall glass building (Tower Place 100) should be to your right. Take a right onto the sidewalk towards it. You will pass Buckhead Document Pros & Buckhead Bridal on your right. Keep going, you’re almost there! At this point, you should be in view of our WeWork Tower Place South building. To get to WeWork Tower Place North, veer to your right to continue walking towards the open courtyard area (outside of AMC Fork & Screen). You’re headed in the right direction if you can see a white WeWork sign in the courtyard just in front of a large grey staircase with orange tracks. Follow the orange tracks up the large staircase. The main entrance to WeWork Tower Place North will be on your right.",
