  "description": "<p>R-Ladies Atlanta welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you are a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community! <br>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Atlanta exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.<\/p>\n<p> <br>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. Here are some links! You can access our presentations, R scripts and more (soon) on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news! <\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.rladies.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rladies.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies<\/a><\/p>\n<p>E-mail: info [at] rladies [dot] org<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><i> PS Community Policies & Code of Conduct: <\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><span>The leadership, mentoring & teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we therefore reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deem appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Atlanta is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. Full community guidelines are found here: <\/span><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki<\/a><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span> <br><\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span>PPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings:<\/span> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Atlanta event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
