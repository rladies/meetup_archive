    "description": "Topic models (TM) are powerful tools to programmatically uncover textual structure in what otherwise appear to be just plain unstructured text. The applications of TM are many, like content analysis, article search, and personalisation of content. Isabelle Valette will take us through what topic models are, the way the algorithm works, and how VG has been using it inside and outside the newsroom.\n\nWho is Isabelle?\nFrench data nerd, nature lover and week-end hiker, Isabelle works as a data scientist at the media house VG, one of Norway's largest newspaper. Educated as an economist and transformed into an RLady, a computer scientist and data journalist, Isa loves #rstats. She is passionate about empowering women to become awesome coders.\n\nAs we are closing in on Christmas, we will also serve som gingerbread (pepperkaker) and gløgg. Bring your self (and a friend?) and a positive attitude!",

    "description": "Every Monday the R for Data Science (R4DS) releases a new dataset on their GitHub that has been tamed, but does not always adhere to “tidy” data principles. This dataset will come from an article with an interesting plot. Our goal is to take a look at the raw data, and generate either a copy of the original plot or a novel take on the data! You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!\n\nWe will come together and work in teams helping each other solve this weeks TidyTuesday challenge. TidyTuesdays are a great way to improve R skills and get involved in the community!\n\n* To participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things *\n\nCreate and save an image of a plot from R\n- Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)\n- Submit the plot and code on Twitter\n- Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)\n- Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!\n\nHowever, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.\n\n* Rules for TidyTuesday *\n\nWe welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:\n\n- This is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.\n- This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!\n- The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.\n- Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.\n- Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.\n- Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!\n- Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! - Make something quick, but purposeful!\n- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.",

    "title": "Bayesian methods for rank and preference data with Valeria Vitelli",
    "description": "Bayesian methods for rank and preference data - from recommendation systems to cancer genomics\n\nRanking items is crucial for collecting information about preferences in many areas, from marketing to politics. The interest often lies both in producing estimates of the consensus ranking of the items, which is shared among users, and in learning individualized preferences of the users, useful for providing personalized recommendations. In the latter task it is particularly relevant to have posterior distributions of individual rankings, since these can provide an evaluation of the uncertainty associated to the estimates, and thus they can avoid unnecessarily spamming the users.\n\nI will present a statistical model which works well in these situations, and which is able of flexibly handling quite different kind of data. The Bayesian paradigm allows a fully probabilistic analysis, and it easily handles missing data and cluster estimation via augmentation procedures.\nInterestingly, this Bayesian framework has also proved to be useful for genomic data integration, since typically heterogeneous microarray data are available from different sources, and their combination allows both to gain statistical power and to strengthen the biological insight.\n\nValeria Vitelli holds a PhD in statistics from Politecnico di Milano, Italy. She was a postdoc at Ecole Centrale Paris for a year, within a research group funded by Eléctricité de France working on big data problems in the energy sector. She then moved to the University of Oslo, where after a 5 years postdoc period funded from the Norwegian Cancer Society she became associate professor in September 2018. Her experience spans over several areas of mathematics and statistics, including functional data analysis with applications in physiology, machine learning (describing people mobility in dense urbanized areas from mobile phone data), and finally statistical genomics of cancer.",

We will incrementally build the dashboard, with explanations throughout to help you understand how the components act together.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, you should have enough basic understanding of shiny to be able to start building your own shiny dashboard.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nLaptop with a working installation of Rstudio with the following additional packages installed:\nshiny,\nshinydashboard,\ngapminder,\ntidyverse,\nDT,\nplotly\n\nAbout the Shiny R-ladies:\n\nAurora is a diverse data scientist in NextBridge Anlytics. She works with innovative and demanding analytical tasks, and has also worked with system developement. Her background is from physics and she has a PhD in the field of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. She has long experience from teaching in academia and began using R some years ago due to a demand for a shiny dashboard.\n\nLene is a physicist turned data scientist. After analysing data for LHC injections at CERN she joined Nextbridge Analytics in 2016. She enjoys working on a wide range of projects using data and algorithms. After being introduced to R for the second time and tidyverse for the first time she really got into R and after learning about R-ladies she was a part of starting up R-ladies Oslo.\n\nFood and refreshments will be provided, a courtesy of NextBridge Analytics.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you all!",

We will be monitoring the situation and keep a dialogue with the speaker open to find a new date when it is responsible to do so.\n\nKathrine Frey Frøslie is an associate professor at NMBU (Norwegian University of Life Sciences) and a knitting blogger! Of course she codes in R, and of course she knits what she codes!\n\n\"What would a knitted ggplot of the Norwegian Birth Registry's monthly numbers look like?\", you may ask. Come to this talk and find out.\n\nCheck out her blog at https://www.statistrikk.no!\n\nWe have the opportunity to provide child-care during the event. Please contact us if you would like us to arrange this.",

    "description": "Because we are not able to meet for a meetup, and the Statistrikk talk is absolutely best to do in person, we are rescheduling this event to August.\nSign up for it in the postponed event: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-oslo/events/270489627/\n\nIn stead we will do a meetup on Rmarkdown online!\n\nRmarkdown is a specialized type of markdown (rich text format) made for R. It provides the opportunity to combine written text with output from R (or even other programming engines) to create integrated documents. It is great for automating report generation, and can make life easier if you find your self needing to do make the same report with slightly different content or input.\n\nMo (Athanasia Mowinckel) will do a talk with a simple introduction to Rmarkdown, and how it can be used in different settings like reports, presentations, posters etc.",
