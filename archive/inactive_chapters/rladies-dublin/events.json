She has frequently used linear regression models in her work on insurance discounting and other analytical problems over the past 18 months and will give a brief and basic introduction to linear regression in R. It will consist of a short initial talk that introduces the subject and a few hands-on examples for everyone to try it out themselves. Bring your laptop with an installation of RStudio if you’d like to take part in the workshop.\n\nThanks to Udemy for providing the meeting space and refreshments.\n\nSee you there!",

We can combine this small area data with national two-way tables, using structure preserving estimation techniques, to estimate even more interesting patterns at small area level. In this talk we will look at the estimation of “highest level of education completed” for parents of children aged 0-14, by small area. This type of analysis might support decisions on where to locate homework clubs or other educational supports.\n\nMarian Keane is an actuary whose work is mostly in the health sector.

We will hear from Chiara Cotroneo on data visualisation with R and Marian Keane on R code efficiencies.\n\nWhen & Where\n\nTuesday, 4th December\nAon's Centre for Innovation and Analytics, Metropolitan Building, James Joyce Street, Dublin 1\n\nThe Agenda\n\n6:00-6:30 Light refreshments & networking\n6:30-7:15 Chiara Cotroneo, Replace Venn diagrams with UpSetR\n7:15-8:00 Marian Keane, How to write efficient R code and reduce run times\n\nThe Speakers & Talks\n\nChiara Cotroneo, PhD Student, Computational Biology at University College Dublin\nChiara is working on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of bacterial genomes. Chiara had previously worked at Instituto dei Tumori di Milano, one of the main Italian institutions for cancer research and therapy. She was in charge of interpreting genomic and clinical patient data. Chiara has been using R for data analysis since 2010. In recent years she has mainly focused on R as a tool to produce beautiful (and informative!) data visualisations.\n\nReplace Venn diagrams with UpSetR\nOne of the common issues in data analysis is to efficiently represent overlap between various classes of objects. The most widespread tool for the task, Venn diagrams, often have poor informative value or are hard to interpret. In this talk, Chiara will introduce UpSetR, originally developed for the analysis of genomic datasets, that provides a great alternative to Venn diagrams.\n\nMarian Keane, Senior Consultant Analyst at Presidion, Version 1 Company\nMarian works with public and commercial organisations to leverage the power of data in order to realise business goals. Marian had previously worked as an independent consultant, data scientist, and actuary.\n\nHow to write efficient R code and reduce run times\nIn this talk, Marian will look at techniques to make R code more efficient and reduce run times. We will try out different algorithms on the same data set to see the difference in run times.\n\nBring your laptop if you want to try out yourself what the speakers will talk about.",

She is currently working on a project on tourism in Ireland where choropleth maps have proved invaluable. They are a very efficient data visualisation technique. Here are some examples: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/chloropleth-map/ (don't mind the typo in the link! it is c-h-o-r-o-p-l-e-t-h :)\n\nJillian is a statistician in the Methodology Division of the Central Statistics Office. Prior to that she was a programmer. Jillian studied Mathematics and Philosophy at University College Cork. She has a master's degree in Official Statistics from the University of Southampton and currently is undertaking a part time PhD in Social Statistics. Her research topic is small area estimation methods that are a powerful way to bridge gaps in data. Jillian works with tools such as R, SAS, SPSS and previously Python.\nOutside of work, she enjoys travelling in Ireland and abroad, yoga, meditation, theatre and music, including playing the Irish harp.\n\nBig thanks to ACIA for hosting and sponsoring the meetup!",

Run this command in the RStudio console: install.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"roxygen2\", \"testthat\")). A github account would be a bonus for the more advanced students.\n\n• After you install the packages\nYou’ll need a set of development tools. On Windows, download and install Rtools, and devtools takes care of the rest. On Mac, install the Xcode command line tools. On Linux, install the R development package, usually called r-devel or r-base-dev.\n\n• Tenable offices\nhttps://www.google.ie/maps/dir//53.3465938,-6.2452115/@53.3465609,-6.2448102,20z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e2?hl=en",

You want to install the Meetings Client.\n\nTune in for a talk on Network Visualisation and Association Rules.\nThis is our first virtual meetup which we're very excited about and we hope you will be too.\n\nGrab a snack or a drink and join us on Thursday, 20th August, at 5:15PM (GMT+1)\n\n5:15-5:20 Welcome\n5:20-5:30 Introductions\n5:30-6:00 Talk: R at RTÉ - Network Visualisation and Association Rules, Ben Norland, Analytics Lead at RTE\n6:00-6:15 Q&A\n\nAbout Ben Norland\nBen Norland is Analytics Lead in the Insights team at RTÉ Ireland's National Television and Radio Broadcaster.\nBen’s objective is developing data-driven solutions, which solve challenges for decision-makers across the organisation. R is his core analytics tool, and he has been using it for 6 years.\n\nAbout the talk\nA few months ago, Ben was confronted with the exciting challenge to use his data analytics knowledge to increase viewer engagement and retention on the RTÉ Player platform.\nThe solution he and the Team provided had impressive outcomes in terms of both operational improvements and a shift to a data-led business approach.\nThe project has also secured a Finalist ticket for the next Analytics Institute Awards in the ‘Analytics Innovation’ category to RTÉ.\nDuring our meeting, Ben will introduce us to his innovative model, which is based on network graph visualisations highlighting key overlaps between programme titles available in the RTÉ Player. He will also discuss the ongoing ‘phase 2’ of his project, which deploys Association Rules modelling.\nFinally, Ben will run a demo to show how network maps are built, updated and how their results can be easily interpreted by non-technical users.\n\nWe'll be recording the event for future reference.\n\nSee you on the Internet :)\nJo, Paola and Sapna",

    "description": "Hello lovely people\n\nWe're back! Our first Meetup of 2020 is next Thursday.\nShout out to our amazing hosts Women@Workday! <3\n\nWe're welcoming back Bruna Wundervald as our speaker. Some of you may remember her great talk on random forests she gave last year.\n\nBruna and I will give a talk on how data scientists work with Git. You can bring your laptop and follow along, because there will be hands-on elements.\n\nThis meetup is aimed at intro/mid-level Data Scientists and Students. You do not need to know R programming to follow along.\nWe prepared material especially for folks who:\n- want to share their work for collaboration with others or to showcase their work\n- want to make their results reproducible (especially for science-related cases)\n- want to learn R from lots of great resources available on GitHub\n\nWe are looking forward to seeing you.\n\nAgenda\n6:00-6:30 arrival and networking\n6:30-6:45 welcome and announcements\n6:45-8:45 talk and demo 'I'm a Data Scientist, Git me out of here!\n\nREAD ON IF YOU WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HANDS-ON PART OF THE MEETUP.\nPrior to the meetup:\n- install git (here are instructions for Mac https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/accessing-the-terminal-and-installing-git.html and Windows https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/accessing-the-terminal-and-installing-git.html#terminal-on-windows)\n- create a GitHub account (https://github.com/join)",

This talk will cover the basic theory of machine learning and introduce both supervised methods and unsupervised methods such as K-means clustering, KNN classification, logistic regression, decision trees and random forests.\n\nGrab a snack and a drink and dial in on Monday, 15th February, at 5:15PM (GMT)\n\n5:15-5:20 Welcome\n5:20-5:30 Introductions\n5:30-7:00 Talk and QA: Intro to machine learning by Fiona Murphy\n\nOur speaker Fiona has been working in data analytics for 3 years, starting off her career in a consulting analytics role at EY and about to begin her next chapter as a customer data analyst at Conjura. She graduated from University College Dublin in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and is currently completing a part time master's in Data Analytics with UCD.
