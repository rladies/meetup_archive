Shannon is currently a Statistician at Adelphi Research in Doylestown, PA.\n\n\"Starting something new in R can be daunting, but there are many community resources that can help! In this presentation, I’ll discuss how I crafted a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling. Despite social distancing, I feel more connected to the R community than ever before!\"\n\nPREPARATION AND RESOURCES\nThere is nothing to prepare in advance. The resources for the workshop are available here: https://github.com/shannonpileggi/growing-into-r\n\nONLINE PROGRAMME\nThe event will be held online and will start at 19:00 (Netherlands time). Please join us via the Zoom link (visible to attendees)\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT\nPlease take a minute to read our code of conduct - we are committed to creating a safe and harassment-free environment:\nhttps://github.com/rladies/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\nR-Ladies events are always free and open to anyone who wants to participate as long as they follow the code of conduct.

    "description": "Join us for our new online boookclub session discussing **‘Hands-On Machine Learning with R**’ by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell! On Monday December 5, we will talk about Chapter 12 - Gradient Boosting.\n\nWe learned about decision trees, bagging, and random forests in the previous sessions. But surprise: there's another variant on tree algorithms on the market, and it's called '**Gradient boosting**'.\n\n*\"Whereas random forests build an ensemble of deep independent trees, GBMs build an ensemble of shallow trees in sequence with each tree learning and improving on the previous one. Although shallow trees by themselves are rather weak predictive models, they can be “boosted” to produce a powerful “committee” that, when appropriately tuned, is often hard to beat with other algorithms.\"* (Hands-On Machine Learning)\n\nThe team spirit of this book club is really flowing and so this chapter will also be presented by one of our community members Ece. Our presenter, Ece Ozler, is from Turkey. She has a graduate degree in Economics from the Koc University in Turkey and a master's in Finance from the Netherlands. She has lived in the Netherlands for almost six years now. She works for an analytics company, FI Analytics, in the banking sector. She uses R and ML to build credit scoring models; C# to build apps that use the prediction models made in R to decide to accept a loan application.\n\n**This boook club:**\nFor this boook club we - the Den Bosch and Utrecht chapters of R Ladies - are joining forces. We will alternate hosting the meetups. In +- 10 meetings (probably more :) ) , we will work through all the chapters in the book together. We are doing this boookclub, because we like to learn together. It is not the case presenters are the experts on the matter. To make this a group effort, the idea is that all participants take turns in presenting chapters, as for example Marianna presented chapter 6, and Elena chapter 7 and 8! We are of course available to help. If you’re not comfortable presenting, just listening is also okay.\nIf you cannot make it this time, feel free to join in on one of the subsequent meetings.\n\n**For who:**\n\n* People who want to take their first steps into machine learning\n* Some prior knowledge on R programming will be helpful. As the authors of the book themselves mention: “This book is not meant to be an introduction to R or to programming in general; as we assume the reader has familiarity with the R language to include defining functions, managing R objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks.”\n\n**What to expect:**\n\n* Presentations summarising the key points on each topic of the book\n* Putting the theory to practice by going through exercises together\n* Room to discuss questions and other thoughts\n\n**Whereabouts**:\n\n* Meet every 2 weeks via Zoom. The password will be sent to you via e-mail before the meeting.\n* We meet every second Monday, from 7 - 8.30 pm\n* It is not necessary to read the chapters in advance, but feel free to do so.\n\nR-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. See the [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/).\nThe book can be found at [https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/). It is also available in print. For the slides of our previous meetings, see [https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club_handsonML](https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club_handsonML).",

    "title": "Book club “Hands-On Machine Learning with R” #4 - Regularised Regression",
    "description": "Want to know more about **regularisation**? Join us for the FOURTH meetup for the online boookclub discussing **‘Hands-On Machine Learning with R**’ by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell. On Monday October 24, we discuss Chapter 6, ‘**Regularised Regression**’.\n\nWe’re delighted to announce that this topic will be presented by Marianna, who is from the R-Ladies community! Marianna is a Ph.D. student in economics, she will be defending her thesis this November after which she will start a post-doc at the University of Barcelona. About R, Marianna says: “I got acquainted with R a couple of years ago, to me first the data-wrangling and data visualization in R was very appealing. Currently, I am using it also for regression analyses, and I am doing my papers in Rmarkdown.” About the topic of this bookclub edition, regularised regression, Marianna says: “I wanted to do a topic that would allow me to learn new things and I hope I can apply it in the future.”\n\nWhen your model contains a lot of predictors, it is likely that your model assumptions, like “no multicollinearity”, will no longer hold. **Regularisation** is a way to deal with this problem by shrinking the model coefficients. During the meeting we will go into more detail on this topic and talk about different kinds of regularised regression.\n\nFor this boook club we - the Den Bosch and Utrecht chapters of R Ladies - are joining forces. We will alternate hosting the meetups. In +- 10 meetings (maybe more :) ) , we will work through all the chapters in the book together. We are doing this boookclub, because we like to learn together. It is not the case presenters are the experts on the matter. To make this a group effort, the idea is that all participants take turns in presenting chapters, as for example Marianna will be presenting chapter 6!

    "description": "Join us for our new online boookclub session discussing ‘Hands-On Machine Learning with R’ by Bradley Boehmke and Brandon Greenwell!\n\nMonday March 27, we will talk about pt IV of the book: Clustering! From the book:\n\nIn PART III of this book we focused on methods for reducing the dimension of our feature space (p). The remaining chapters concern methods for reducing the dimension of our observation space (n); these methods are commonly referred to as *clustering*. *K*-means clustering is one of the most commonly used clustering algorithms for partitioning observations into a set of k groups (i.e. k clusters), where k is pre-specified by the analyst. *k*-means, like other clustering algorithms, tries to classify observations into mutually exclusive groups (or clusters), such that observations within the same cluster are as similar as possible (i.e., high intra-class similarity), whereas observations from different clusters are as dissimilar as possible (i.e., low inter-class similarity). In *k*-means clustering, each cluster is represented by its center (i.e, centroid) which corresponds to the mean of the observation values assigned to the cluster. The procedure used to find these clusters is similar to the *k*-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm discussed in Chapter [8](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/knn.html#knn); albeit, without the need to predict an average response value.\n\nThese chapters (20-22) will be presented by one of the organizers of R Ladies Den Bosch: Martine.\n\nThe attentive reader might notice that we skipped part III of the book: dimension reduction. This part contains chapter 17 Principal Components Analysis, 18 Generalised Low Rank models, and 19 Autoencoders. If you are looking for a fun little challenge and would like to present one or more of these chapters, please send us a message!",

Often, these models are considered “black boxes” due to their complex inner-workings. However, because of their complexity, they are typically more accurate for predicting nonlinear, faint, or rare phenomena. Unfortunately, more accuracy often comes at the expense of interpretability, and interpretability is crucial for business adoption, model documentation, regulatory oversight, and human acceptance and trust. Luckily, several advancements have been made to aid in interpreting ML models over the years and this chapter demonstrates how you can use them to extract important insights.\nThis chapter will be presented by one of the authors of the book: Brandon Greenwell!",

    "description": "Our last meetup has been a while, but that is going to change!\n\nOur upcoming meet-up ( a joined event with RLadies DenBosch) is an actual in-person meet in Utrecht! And we have a very special guest: **Jenny Bryan** will be in the Netherlands, and offered to have a talk for us at a meet about R package development. What a wonderful opportunity to meet in person with Jenny and other R-Ladies!\n\nJenny will be talking about R Package development (https://r-pkgs.org/).\n\nSURF Utrecht kindly offered to host this special occasion. SURF is a cooperative association of Dutch educational and research institutions in which the members work together to acquire or develop the best possible digital services, and to encourage knowledge sharing through continuous innovation ([https://www.surf.nl/en/about](https://www.surf.nl/en/about)). And it is very close to the main train station in Utrecht.\n\nR-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. See the [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\nCome join us in Utrecht!",
