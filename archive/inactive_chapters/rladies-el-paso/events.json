    "description": "A note from Marguerite:\n\nHi Rladies participants,\n\nI will be demonstrating some uses of ggplot, one of R’s graphing packages. I’ll give a short intro and then we’ll do a code-along so that everyone can do their own typing.\nWe will make a few basic figures and then experiment with customizing to make them pretty.\nSome code will be pre-written to make it easier to keep up, and some parts you will have to fill in.\n\nTo prepare, please pre-load the Tidyverse package in R, on a WiFi connection.\n\n# Tidyverse has a number of basic packages that all load together using the command:\ninstall.packages(“tidyverse”)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nCheck that you definitely have:\nggplot2\ndplyr\ntidyr\nreadr\nOn the day of the workshop, we will have the code template and data on USB drives so that you can easily load it to your computer offline. We will use some data that from my research in the Chihuahuan desert looking at rainfall and how water it moves through the soil. It’s for demonstration purposes only and I think has many features that would appear in other data problems.\n\nTidyverse is a nice set of packages that work together to make coding and data structure smoother.\nMore information about Tidyverse is here:\nhttps://www.tidyverse.org/packages/",
