    "description": "R-Ladies & R User Group Year-end Meetup\n\nTo celebrate a wonderful year of #rstats learning and community, R-Ladies and the R User Group are coming together for a year-end social event.\n\nWe’re going to be watching The Computers documentary which tells the inspirational story of the women behind the ENIAC.\n\nIn 1946 six brilliant young women programmed the first all-electronic, programmable computer, the ENIAC, a project run by the U.S. Army as part of a secret World War II project. They learned to program without programming languages or tools (for none existed) ̶ only logical diagrams. By the time they were finished, ENIAC ran a ballistics trajectory perfectly! Yet when the ENIAC was unveiled to the press and the public in 1946, the women were never introduced… and their story was lost for decades.\n\n*There will be secure parking available.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nDriving\nWe have safe and secure underground parking at the building. The entrance can be found on the slip from Harrison st to Smit st. It is near impossible to access this entrance from Smit st in the evenings, so try to come down Harrison street. The entrance is labeled \"209 Smit Street Parking\". Drive down the ramp and you will be met by security who will direct you to the visitors parking. Take the lift to the ground floor and from there follow the signs to the Meetup.\n\nGautrain & Walking\nBraamfontein Gate is a 5-minute walk from Park Station. Ask Gautrain security for directions. Braamfontein Gate is the Uber pick up point for Park Station, so they should be able to point you in the right direction. Walk through the front doors and turn right. You'll find us at the bottom of the stairs.",

    "description": "Data science projects can go wrong in a million ways. To get it done well, you need to manage the expectations from day 0. How do you do this?\n\nThis talk by Merelda Wu distills the art form of \"talking to business\" to a list of non-scientific formulas that can be applied in your everyday life.\nIf any of the following resonates with you, join us:\n\n1. The magic wand problem? Data doesn’t just give you “actionable insight”, you need to ask the right question.\n2. Misaligned expectations? The classic case of what you say you want, is not what you really, really want.\n3. The scope creep problem? Sure, of course I can re-write everything and give it to you five minutes ago.\n4. The big data problem? No darling, you don’t have big data if it fits in Excel.\n5. The confidence challenge? No, there’s no such thing as 100% accurate, also we use this thing called the F1 score.\n6. The cloud challenge? Yes cloud would be great, but your data's gotta be there first though.\n\nThis talk shares some common problems faced in most data science projects. Some heart-aching stories will be shared, as well as some great tools and tips that will help you speak to your business logically, with tons of visual aid and zero mathematical equations.",

How about starting a new blog, with R Markdown (Rmd)?\n\nMaëlle Salmon (https://masalmon.eu/), R(esearch) Software Engineer and a proud R-Lady, will be helping us get started!\n\nIn this 2-hour course with live coding, we'll go on two short adventures:\n\n- setting up a scientific Rmd blog with the Distill framework, and the distill package\n\n- setting up a scientific Rmd blog with the Hugo website generator and the hugodown package (also quickly presenting blogdown)\n\nWe'll prepare for the adventures by defining what we expect of an Rmd blog. We'll end the course by reflecting on each adventure as well as mentioning important future paths such as how to promote your blog. You should leave the course ready to start an R Markdown blog with your tool of choice, and knowing where to find more resources and help.\n\nWebsite: https://rmd-blogging-jozi.netlify.app/\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nMaëlle works remotely from Nancy, France, where she lives with her family.\nShe is a research software engineer with rOpenSci, besides other projects. In particular, currently, she works on the \"HTTP testing in R\" book thanks to funding from the R Consortium. She created the R-hub blog that features more or less niche topics about R package development, also thanks to funding by the R Consortium.\nShe also volunteers as an associate editor for rOpenSci's Software Peer Review (peer-review system of R packages), the main manager of R-Ladies Global Twitter account, and a member of the R Weekly team.",

The tutorial is valuable for everyone, but especially so for Masters and PhD students - if you know anyone who is busy with either of these, please encourage them to sign up on our group and RSVP :).\n\nDescription:\nHave you ever struggled to re-run your own code or scripts you received from a collaborator? You’re not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/) to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on and interactive, with small-group exercises.\n\nPrerequisites:\nParticipants should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing these short guides before participating in the tutorial: [Introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), [How It Works](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html), [Code Chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html].\n\nRequirements:\nA web browser, an account on GitHub (https://github.com/), and an account on RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/). We will email you the tutorial materials, please also check your Spam / Junk Folder as materials often end up there when sent via Meetup.\n\nInstructors:\nDr. Inger Fabris-Rotelli (and Vebash Naidoo) on behalf of Dr. John Blischak & Dr. Peter Carbonetto.\n\nIt will be an online meetup, and the link will be posted closer to the date.",

    "description": "**We're excited to be collaborating with R-Ladies Dammam and talking with, and giving feedback to Biandri!**\n\n**We are co-hosting this interactive session where participants who have no background in R are strongly encouraged to attend and participants with backgrounds in R, but no legal background, are also strongly encouraged to attend.**\n\nThe presenter will share an ongoing project currently underway during a mentorship through Open Life Sciences (OLS). The project aims to create an open educational resource demonstrating the “why” for people from legal backgrounds who might want to learn R. It is partly a case for open and reproducible research in a field that does not typically use R and quantitative methods. The project also involves creating different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a single platform with a few examples of practical use and application as well as code.\n\nWe will design this session as a mix of demo, silent reflections and group discussions to bring diverse perspectives into the conversation. We will use a shared document for collaborative notetaking and capturing feedback and learnings also from those who cannot or prefer not to speak during the session.\n\n**WHO is this for?**\n\n* Individuals who have no background in R.\n* Individuals who background in R, but no legal background.\n* Both beginners and experienced R users are welcome to join!\n\n**AGENDA**\n5:30–6:00 pm Talk by Biandri Joubert\n6:00–6:20 pm Breakoutroom\n6:20–6:30 pm Discussion and wrap up\n\n**Place: Zoom- https://zoom.us/download - The event will not be recorded.**\nWe will send you the Zoom link & the passcode via email a few hours before the meetup. Please check out your email later.\nWe look forward to welcoming you!\n\n**This event is a joint meeting between R-Ladies Dammam and R-Ladies Johannesburg, you can register on either page.**\n**R-Ladies Dammam Page**\nhttps://www.meetup.com/rladies-dammam/events/286330344/",

    "description": "The Functions in Rtistry workshop will dive into using functions to create, add variation to, and streamline generative art pieces made in the R language. While you don't have to be an R expert to attend, some of the material expects that the viewer has a basic understanding of using the ggplot2 package and functional programming basics in R. This talk will go over the benefits of using functions from Base R and the Purrr package, different types of functions that can be created for generative art, and more. The workshop will end with a live coding rtistry session that viewers can follow along with. The code created in the live coding session will be available shortly after the session on GitHub.\n\nWebsite: https://www.thetidytrekker.com/\n\nGitHub Link to the Repository:\nhttps://github.com/Meghansaha/Functions_in_Rtistry\n\nGitHub Link to the Slides:\nhttps://meghansaha.github.io/Functions_in_Rtistry/#1\n\nAbout the speaker:\nMeghan Harris is a self-taught R user that is a data integration specialist at the University at Buffalo and the Erie County government of New York. Meghan’s work focuses on integrating opioid-related data sources and creating custom reports, dashboards, and solutions using the R programming language. In Meghan’s spare time, Meghan creates generative art in the R programming language, called Rtistry.",

    "description": "“Develop an R package”, they said… What does this even mean? In this session with a live demo, we shall demystify the creation of an R package. R packages are mostly well-organized folders, and there are automatic tools to help. Let’s dive into the wonders of usethis! We shall also see why to create a package (or not). We shall furthermore explain how to improve your R package and your own package development skills. And how to solve the specific new challenges you will encounter! Last but not least we will discuss how to find your happy place in the world of R package development. Do you want to be more of a devoted maintainer of one single package? Or perhaps a valued contributor to dozens of packages?\n\nMaëlle Salmon (https://masalmon.eu/), R(esearch) Software Engineer and a proud R-Lady, will be helping us get started!\n\nWebsite: https://rladies-jozi-r-pkg-dev.netlify.app/\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nMaëlle works remotely from Nancy, France, where she lives with her family.\nShe is a research software engineer with rOpenSci, besides other projects. In particular, currently, she works on the \"HTTP testing in R\" book thanks to funding from the R Consortium. She created the R-hub blog that features more or less niche topics about R package development, also thanks to funding by the R Consortium.\nShe also volunteers as an associate editor for rOpenSci's Software Peer Review (peer-review system of R packages), the main manager of R-Ladies Global Twitter account, and a member of the R Weekly team.",
