You’ll also learn to use R package dplyr to wrangle your data; this includes making and/or transforming variables. After the demos, we'll have some time to chat and try out our new skills.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\nBring your laptop. Your laptop cord and a notebook might be a good idea, too. If you can, try to install R, R Studio, and the dplyr package before coming.\n\nVOLUNTEERS:\n\nAmanda Doan will demonstrate how to use R Markdown and Katie Jolly will teach us how to use dplyr.\n\nCONSUMING THINGS:\n\nJust down the hall is a mini coffee shop. (Bring your own mug to get 25 cents off!) Feel free to bring snackies or beverages from home.\n\nLOCATION:\n\nMeet us in room 226 of O'Shaughnessy Science (OSS). This is connected to Owens and is part of the Frey Science Center (big cement sign out front). OSS is on the west side of Cretin between Grand and Summit. The east side of the building has an elevator and the building is ADA accessible.\n\nPARKING:\n\nYou can park on Summit for free. The parking ramp (on Grand and Cretin) is very close to OSS and is decently priced ($1.00 or $1.50 per hour).",

You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents or build dashboards (http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/). Here's an example of a Shiny app (https://dgrtwo.shinyapps.io/cranview/) from David Robinson (the stats guy, not the basketball player).\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\nBring your laptop. Your laptop cord and a notebook might be a good idea, too. If you can, try to install R and the Shiny package before coming.\n\nCONSUMING THINGS:\n\nJust down the hall is a mini coffee shop (open til 8PM).

I think we will cover plotting in base R and get into ggplot a bit. I'm happy to add another topic if you have any ideas! This is a safe, non-competitive environment to try new things.\n\nWHAT TO BRING:\n\nBring your laptop. Your laptop cord and a notebook might be a good idea, too. If you have any cool data sets, bring 'em!\n\nCONSUMING THINGS:\n\nJust down the hall is a mini coffee shop. You can get your espresso, drip coffee, tea, and other snacks there for cheap. (Bring your own mug and you get $0.25 off!)\n\nLOCATION:\n\nWe have a classroom for this meetup! Meet us in room 226 of O'Shaughnessy Science. This is the building connected to Owens science. You can park on Summit for free. The parking ramp is also convenient and decently priced ($1.00 or $1.50 per hour). The east side of the building has an elevator and the building is generally accessible.\n\nVOLUNTEERS:\n\nWho wants to volunteer to help out with the content for this meetup? Remember, this is a safe environment for pushing yourself. I'm visualizing (ha.) you finding a data set, creating code that produces a few important types of plots, and coming up with a list of challenges (e.g. \"create a plot that demonstrates the difference in bitterness between different types of beer.\"). Someone (maybe YOU?) can prepare materials for plotting in base R (e.g. plot, boxplot) and another person (Katie Jolly) will prepare some materials for ggplot.",

This Thursday is the last one and it’s being hosted at Rondo Community Library! I’ll (the “citizen user” representative) be there on a panel with some of the open data staff to talk about community organizations, civic engagement, and data privacy. We’ve had kids come in the past too and they seem to enjoy it. There are snacks and lemonade, hope to see some of you there! There’ll be very little if any discussion of R, but I think the open data is interesting to know about anyway :)\n\nIf you’re taking the green line, it’s right by the Dale Street stop.\n\nLink: https://sppl.org/data-party/",

This is unfortunate, because multilevel modeling can be a useful tool when data generating processes are hierarchical in nature--a situation which can be quite common in social, ecological, and political systems.\n\nAlison Link will explore some of the multilevel modeling techniques and philosophies discussed in the book \"Statistical Rethinking\" by Richard McElreath, and explore how these concepts can be applied to a public salaries dataset on Minnesota state employees. The goal? Learn something new about about multilevel modeling AND generate some interesting findings about Minnesota state employee compensation!",
