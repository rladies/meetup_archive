Cosima has created a blog (https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/socialsciencedatalab/) where she and her fellow researchers write about their science adventures, and has created a veRy useful package, overvieweR (https://cosimameyer.github.io/overviewR/). Read more about her on the webpage http://cosimameyer.rbind.io/.\n\nAbout the talk:\n\n\"Taking the text data analysis to the next level - Using supervised and unsupervised approaches in NLP\"\n\nText data provides an oasis of information for both researchers and non-researchers alike to explore. Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods help make sense of this difficult data type, which is written text. The talk will give you a smooth introduction to the quanteda package (https://quanteda.io/). I will also showcase how to quickly visualize your text data and cover both supervised and unsupervised approaches in NLP. As part of a code demo, we will use text data from the UN as a working example to give you first insights into the structure of text data and how to work with it.",

Let's dive into the wonders of usethis!\nWe shall also see why to create a package (or not).\nWe shall furthermore explain how to improve your R package and your own package development skills. And how to solve the specific new challenges you will encounter!\nLast but not least we will discuss how to find your happy place in the world of R package development. Do you want to be more of a devoted maintainer of one single package? Or perhaps a valued contributor to dozens of packages?\n\nAbout the speaker:\n\nMaëlle works remotely from Nancy, France, where she lives with her family.\nShe is a research software engineer with rOpenSci, besides other projects. In particular, currently, she works on the \"HTTP testing in R\" book thanks to funding from the R Consortium. She created the R-hub blog that features more or less niche topics about R package development, also thanks to funding by the R Consortium.\nShe also volunteers as an associate editor for rOpenSci's Software Peer Review (peer-review system of R packages), the main manager of R-Ladies Global Twitter account, and a member of the R Weekly team.",

Mo does brain research at the University of Oslo where she is an advanced user of R and technology at large. Recently she wrote a little package to help other academics overcome the challenges (and trauma) of uploading CRAN and BioConductor packages to TSD (Service for Sensitive Data). Thank you for that Mo!\n\nIn this talk, she will showcase some of the methods she uses and develops. The methods have been applied to longitudinal brain measurements, however mixed models have a variety of applications in economics, social sciences, genetics and even animal husbandry.\n\nWelcome Mo!

With R Markdown, we can write a manuscript that can be executed to typical document formats. Using Git version control helps us to track changes as we write our code and text. This standard compendium structure organizes our files nicely and enables other researchers to easily inspect our data and analytical processes to enhance research reproducibility in anthropology.\n\nLi-Ying Wang (she/her) short bio:\nLi-Ying Wang is a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Washington. Her study focuses on a 14-19th century site in northeastern Taiwan during the European colonization period. She employs multiple computational methods to visualize and analyze archaeological data, including spatial analysis, shape analysis, and Bayesian network modeling using R. She is very interested in open science and reproducible research and incorporates these approaches into her analysis, writing, and teaching practices.\n\nNOTE: If you are in Bergen, come join us for a physical meeting right before Li-Ying's talk: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-bergen/events/280261260/",

    "description": "Federica Giardina is a public health researcher currently working as an assistant professor in Biostatistics at Radboud University Medical Center (Radboud UMC) in Nijmegen (the Netherlands). She uses Bayesian methods to answer questions in infectious disease epidemiology. Bayesian statistics allows the user to specify prior information to the chosen model. This method is useful, for example, when working with datasets with partially missing data, as is often the case in public health records.\n\nFederica will introduce the Stan programming language (https://mc-stan.org/) with examples of modeling performed with the rstan package.\n\nIt's a short introduction, a sweet taste if you like, of a very broad topic that we have been anxious to learn about.

Despite the steep learning curve, a system of best practices contributes to successful collaboration and reproducibility. Arushi Garg (http://arushigarg.com/) learned many of these best coding practices as a software engineer where she was required to follow rigorous quality standards.\n\nToday, Arushi is a PhD candidate at the Donders Centre for Cognition and in the International Max Planck Research School for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. She will share her own best practices that she has adapted in her scientific work when coding in R. These important skills allow her to focus more of her time and energy on understanding her field of study.\n\nIt is a delight and inspiration to read her code. Join us and see why!",

    "description": "We continue to learn from the best! In February, we will hear how R is used in everyday research and teaching activities by Mette Langaas, an enthusiastic R-Lady from Trondheim, Norway. The talk will take ca. 45 minutes, followed by ca. 15 minutes of discussion. If you've ever wanted to improve and automate your work, come hear this expert´s tips!\n\nAbout Mette´s talk:\nEvery workday for 30 years the language S – and later R – has been a central part of my scientific life. I code, I analyse, I do research, I supervise, and I teach with the help of R. In the last years, R Markdown and Git have become important ingredients for reproducibility in my research, as well as for writing and distributing learning materials for open science. In this presentation, I will give examples of how I use R and R Markdown in my teaching and learning.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nMette Langaas is a statistician at NTNU and NR, with (probably) above average interest in teaching and communicating statistics. Her field of research is biostatistics/genomics/medical statistics and her methodological focus is on statistical inference and learning.\n\nhttps://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mette.langaas\nhttps://www.nr.no/user-info?query=langaas\n\nTwitter: @mettelang\nGithub: @mettelang",

    "description": "R-Ladies Bergen and R-Ladies Cologne are kicking off a “Toolbox for Reproducibility” series! We will dive into tips, tricks, and techniques about adhering to Coding Best Practices and making our code (and workflows) reproducible.\n\nWe’re more than excited to have **Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel**, professor at Duke University (USA) as well as Developer Educator at Posit, as our first speaker of the series. We will learn from her how to use Quarto to discover the world of possibilities.\n\n✨ Hello, Quarto: A World of Possibilities (for Reproducible Publishing) ✨\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. This talk will introduce you to creating reproducible, computational documents, from course notes to journal manuscripts to books and web pages with Quarto. Familiarity with R and RStudio will be helpful to follow along with the demos; however, those who work with any computational documents in any language (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks with Python) will also find the content relevant. The advantage of Quarto is that it is language-agnostic and can be used to create dynamic content with any computing language!\n\nIf you’re up for joining us, RSVP here. We will share all access details for our virtual event beforehand.\n\nWe’re very much looking forward to seeing many of you! ☺️",

Earning my PhD in Visualization from the University of Bergen in 2022, my work focuses on visual exploration and communication of information, mainly from the health and life sciences. I am also a professional biomedical artist, meaning I've drawn guts for a living. Prior to my PhD, I worked for six years as an artist and content director in medical education start-ups in Silicon Valley, Chicago, and New York City. I love combining art, science, and technology to help people understand data or concepts, especially in the areas of biology and medicine. More recently, I've become interested in developing visualizations that are more accessible, i.e., usable and understandable, for different segments of the population. Currently, I divide my time as a consultant at Bouvet ASA and at the Mohn Medical Imaging and Visualization Centre (MMIV) at Haukeland Univ. Hospital in Bergen.",

    "description": "Join us for the second meeting of the online book club discussing **‘[Happy Git and Github for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)**’ by Jenny Bryan.\n**When:** Tuesday November 19 @ 17:00 CET (11:00 ET)\n**Where:** [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87240540921?pwd=E4Lm8qap1SGhIWgakNCVtyjjcs95b6.1)\n**What:** We will discuss the parts *Installation* and *Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio* of the [book](https://happygitwithr.com/).\nBook club materials can be found on our [Github](https://github.com/rladiesboookclub/happygitwithr). The Github also has a discussions page where participants can ask questions or discuss different aspects of the book as they move through it. For help using GitHub discussions see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart).\n**Who:** Our presenter will be co-host **Sehee Rim** from [R-Ladies Bergen](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-bergen/).\n**Why:** For this book club we - the Bergen, Den Bosch and Amsterdam chapters of R Ladies - are joining forces. We will meet every two weeks, and in each meeting, we will work through a different chapter of the book together. We are doing this boook club (spelling intentional), because we like to learn together. It is not the case presenters are necessarily the experts on the matter. To make this a group effort, the idea is that all participants take turns presenting chapters. If you’re not comfortable presenting, just listening is also okay.\nIf you cannot make it this time, feel free to join in on one of the subsequent meetings.\nR-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. See the [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/coc/).\n*As always, everyone, regardless of gender identity, is welcome to join our events!*\n**Cross-posting:** This event is cross posted on the [R-Ladies Den Bosch](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-den-bosch/events/304441935) and [R-Ladies Amsterdam](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-amsterdam/events/304454190/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link) meet-up pages.",

In a couple of meeting, we will work through all the chapters in the book together. We are doing this boook club, because we like to learn together. It is not the case presenters are necessarily the experts on the matter. To make this a group effort, the idea is that all participants take turns in presenting chapters. If you’re not comfortable presenting, just listening is also okay.\nIf you cannot make it this time, feel free to join in on one of the subsequent meetings.\nR-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. See the [code of conduct](https://rladies.org/coc/).\nThe book can be found at [https://happygitwithr.com/](https://happygitwithr.com/)",
