    "description": "December Rise & Shiny will cover topics in Interactive Maps and how to use the Leaflet package/framework in Shiny apps. We're going to try a slightly different format this month: less \"lecture\" tutorial, and more \"choose your own adventure\" tutorial. Our goal will be to publish tutorial material on Friday night, before the workshop, so that you can get a sense for what part or sections you might like to try working through on Saturday morning.\n\nTopics of Interest:\n- The leaflet package\n- R packages for extending leaflet\n- GeoJSON (what is it / how to create it)\n- Alternatives to leaflet\n- Github and shinyapps.io\n- Coffee and Muffins!\n\nThanks as always to our sponsor, B23 - platform.b23.io\n\nThis event is open to all members of the RStats community who support our mission of increasing gender diversity in tech. If this is your first meetup with us, please take a moment to read our code of conduct (https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct) before committing to attend.",

Our event is a little different.\n\nThis event is inspired by places on the internet like kaggle datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and data.world (http://data.world/) that want to collect, tag, store and host open data submitted by YOU.\n\nPeople and organizations all over the world are taking the time to curate information sources (census, social media, web sites, finance, community projects, academic research…) and then turning that information into clean, well described data sets in easily accessible and ingestible formats for anyone to use.\n\nWe’re planning two 45 minute tutorials to help get people started:\n\n- Easy web scraping in R with the rvest package\n\n- Managing datasets on Data.World through Github and/or Google Sheets\n\nThe rest of the time is for getting together (in teams or individually) to create open data sets that have never existed before! Check out kaggle and data.world to start getting inspired by the awesome data being hosted there.\n\n12:30 PM Arrival - Socializing\n\n1:00 PM Welcome - Goals\n\n1:15 PM Tutorial - Web Scraping in R with the rvest Package\n\n2:00 PM Start Data Curation/Creation!

    "title": "RLadies DC Book Club - Programmed Inequality",
    "description": "Spend your Thanksgiving reading about the history of women in technology! Then join us for our first RLadiesDC book club meetup on 11 December at 6pm!\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262535181/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1#customerReviews\n\nOur first book is Programmed Inequality, which discusses how Britain lost its early dominance in computing by systematically discriminating against its most qualified workers: women.\n\nIn 1944, Britain led the world in electronic computing. By 1974, the British computer industry was all but extinct. What happened in the intervening thirty years holds lessons for all postindustrial superpowers. As Britain struggled to use technology to retain its global power, the nation's inability to manage its technical labor force hobbled its transition into the information age.\n\nIn Programmed Inequality, Marie Hicks explores the story of labor feminization and gendered technocracy that undercut British efforts to computerize. That failure sprang from the government's systematic neglect of its largest trained technical workforce simply because they were women. Women were a hidden engine of growth in high technology from World War II to the 1960s. As computing experienced a gender flip, becoming male-identified in the 1960s and 1970s, labor problems grew into structural ones and gender discrimination caused the nation's largest computer user―the civil service and sprawling public sector―to make decisions that were disastrous for the British computer industry and the nation as a whole.\n\nDrawing on recently opened government files, personal interviews, and the archives of major British computer companies, Programmed Inequality takes aim at the fiction of technological meritocracy.Hicks explains why, even today, possessing technical skill is not enough to ensure that women will rise to the top in science and technology fields. Programmed Inequality shows how the disappearance of women from the field had grave macroeconomic consequences for Britain, and why the United States risks repeating those errors in the twenty-first century.",

P. Teate, @BecomingDataSci on Twitter, organizes a vibrant data science learning community via her website and social media presence. One of her initiatives is the Summer of Data Science. To participate, here are the steps:\n\n1. Pick a thing or a short list of things related to data science that you want to learn more about this summer.\n\n2. Make a plan to learn it (like an online course, a practice project, etc.).\n\n3. Share that plan on social media, then post updates as you make progress, with the hashtag #SoDS18.\n\nCheck out Renee's blog post for SoDS17 here: https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2017/05/29/summer-of-data-science-2017/\n\nLet's meet at Continental Beer Garden, socialize, swap ideas, form accountability teams, and plan out the perfect summer!

Lightning talks can be about anything! The art and practice of crafting these talks is great because it forces you to work on:\n- Choosing a topic that you care about enough to share\n- Condensing your expertise into a short/digestable format\n- Realizing that you DO have something interesting to say\n- Not freaking out about whether other people will find it interesting\n- Clear and effective presentation design\n- (Eventually) Clear and effective verbal presentation skills\n\nAt this workshop we'll cover what a lightning talk is, and we'll work on developing them. You don't need to come with an idea in mind, we'll work on brainstorming topic ideas as part of the session.\n\n• What to bring\nA laptop or plain old pen&paper\n\n• Important to know\nThis R-Ladies Meetup Event is open to anyone of any gender.

This book’s sampling is selected by Justice Ginsburg and her authorized biographers Mary Hartnett and Wendy W.

    "description": "“The best job in America.” “The sexist job of the 21st century.” Data Scientist, a title that didn’t even exist before 2008, is now the position employers can’t hire enough of and job seekers strive to become. With this popularity comes more and more people vying for entry-level data science jobs. How can you stand out from the crowd and actually land your first job as a data scientist?\n\nFortunately, our speaker, Emily Robinson, is writing a book, “Build a Career in Data Science,” on that very topic. Along with her co-author Jacqueline Nolis, she covers all of the non-technical skills you need to get and succeed in your first data science jobs. (https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science)\n\nIn this talk, Emily will cover what skills you need to start your career, the different types of data scientist jobs, and how to best position yourself based on your academic and work history. She’ll show you how to make not only a standout resume and cover letter but also a strong data science portfolio of projects and blog posts. If you’ve been struggling to break into the field or are even just curious about what the data science hype is all about, this talk is for you.",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Lab Girl: A story of trees, science, and love.\n\nPurchase the book here: https://www.amazon.com/Lab-Girl-Hope-Jahren/dp/1101873728 - also available at some public libraries.\n\nAcclaimed scientist Hope Jahren has built three laboratories in which she’s studied trees, flowers, seeds, and soil. Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more.\n\nLab Girl is a book about work, love, and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.\n\nYet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again, over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii, where she and her lab currently make their home.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

I will then focus more specifically on the Renewable Energy and Water (RENeW) Nexus project, which was funded under the Australian Smart Cities and Suburbs scheme. RENeW Nexus explores renewable energy and water usage and the potential for \"trading\" renewables between peers. As part of this project I am working on creating visualisations that can be used for sharing data and results with other researchers as well as the public. I will show and share my initial workflow for putting together a dashboard as well as work to animate the data using R.\n\nBio - Rebecca completed her PhD in astronomy at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research at the University of Western Australia. During her PhD she studied the mass-size relation of galaxies, for which she analysed images from several ground- and space-based telescopes and also accessed, cross matched and analysed other relevant data for over 10000 galaxies in the GAMA survey database.\n\nBefore Rebecca moved to Perth she studied Astronomy and Physics at Nottingham Trent University where she also worked as a research assistant in scientific imaging for art conservation and archaeology. Her work there included the development and testing of instruments and software for imaging and spectroscopy as well as the organisation and supervision of field trips, which often required liaising with art curators and conservators.\n\nThroughout her studies and research work she has gained extensive programming as well as data analytics and visualisation experience in various programming languages.\nRebecca is particularly interested in applying her technical skills to support and train researchers in the digital humanities.",

And why is it so hard for competent people--especially competent women--to advance?\n\nMarshaling decades of rigorous research, Chamorro-Premuzic points out that although men make up a majority of leaders, they underperform when compared with female leaders. In fact, most organizations equate leadership potential with a handful of destructive personality traits, like overconfidence and narcissism. In other words, these traits may help someone get selected for a leadership role, but they backfire once the person has the job.\n\nWhen competent women--and men who don't fit the stereotype--are unfairly overlooked, we all suffer the consequences. The result is a deeply flawed system that rewards arrogance rather than humility, and loudness rather than wisdom.\n\nThere is a better way. With clarity and verve, Chamorro-Premuzic shows us what it really takes to lead and how new systems and processes can help us put the right people in charge.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you lack the funds to purchase the book.",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Brave, Not Perfect: Fear Less, Fail More, and Live Bolder by the founder of Girls Who Code.\n\nPurchase the book here: https://www.amazon.com/Brave-Not-Perfect-Fear-Bolder/dp/1524762334/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1549747438&sr=8-1&keywords=brave+not+perfect\n\nIn a book inspired by her popular TED talk, New York Times bestselling author Reshma Saujani empowers women and girls to embrace imperfection and bravery. Watch the TED talk here: https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection?language=en#t-743449\n\nImagine if you lived without the fear of not being good enough. If you didn't care how your life looked on Instagram, or worry about what total strangers thought of you. Imagine if you could let go of the guilt, and stop beating yourself up for tiny mistakes. What if, in every decision you faced, you took the bolder path?\n\nToo many of us feel crushed under the weight of our own expectations. We run ourselves ragged trying to please everyone, all the time. We lose sleep ruminating about whether we may have offended someone, pass up opportunities that take us out of our comfort zones, and avoid rejection at all costs.\n\nThere's a reason we act this way, Reshma says. As girls, we were taught to play it safe. Well-meaning parents and teachers praised us for being quiet and polite, urged us to be careful so we didn't get hurt, and steered us to activities at which we could shine.\n\nThe problem is that perfect girls grow up to be women who are afraid to fail. It's time to stop letting our fears drown out our dreams and narrow our world, along with our chance at happiness.\n\nBy choosing bravery over perfection, we can find the power to claim our voice, to leave behind what makes us unhappy, and go for the things we genuinely, passionately want. Perfection may set us on a path that feels safe, but bravery leads us to the one we're authentically meant to follow.\n\nIn Brave, Not Perfect, Reshma shares powerful insights and practices to help us override our perfect girl training and make bravery a lifelong habit. By being brave, not perfect, we can all become the authors of our biggest, boldest, and most joyful life.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you lack the funds to purchase the book.",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing the history of Bayes' theorem at a women-owned brewery near DC.\n\nPurchase the book here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300188226/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nBayes' rule appears to be a straightforward, one-line theorem: by updating our initial beliefs with objective new information, we get a new and improved belief. To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about learning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok.\n\nIn the first-ever account of Bayes' rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch McGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the human obsessions surrounding it. She traces its discovery by an amateur mathematician in the 1740s through its development into roughly its modern form by French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why respected statisticians rendered it professionally taboo for 150 years—at the same time that practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving great uncertainty and scanty information (Alan Turing's role in breaking Germany's Enigma code during World War II), and explains how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in the 1980s proved to be a game-changer. Today, Bayes' rule is used everywhere from DNA de-coding to Homeland Security.\n\nDrawing on primary source material and interviews with statisticians and other scientists, The Theory That Would Not Die is the riveting account of how a seemingly simple theorem ignited one of the greatest controversies of all time.",

But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.\n\nCelebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates the shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women​, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "description": "The AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowship is a long-standing program that brings scientists to the DMV for 1 - 3 years of service in a variety of roles throughout the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the federal government. Our brief stints as a AAAS Policy Fellow introduced us to many of the ways in which scientists contribute to government and policy, gave us an in-depth look at the processes of a small part of a massive federal agency, and led to collaborations and friendships with some amazing scientists pursuing careers in government and policy. In this informal talk, we will share our experiences with the application process and in the fellowship, an overview of what we learned and gained from the program, and what limited advice we can offer to anyone interested in the fellowship.\n\nWynn Meyer is an assistant professor of Biological Sciences at Lehigh University, where she is starting a lab to research genomic changes associated with dietary variation in mammals, and teaches Personal Genomics and Biostatistics. Her somewhat meandering career path has included jobs with a Red Cross genetic testing lab, an anti-hunger non-profit, research with species ranging from yeast to flies to lemurs to manatees, and most recently a AAAS policy fellowship at the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy. In this role she developed the NIH DATA Scholars Program, co-chaired a panel on artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare for the AAAS Human Impacts of AI symposium, and facilitated connections between NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in data science. Wynn loves R and its wide range of applications but is still learning how to use the tidyverse.\n\nSam Tyner is a data scientist at Tritura, a technology services company that specializes in legal services. Sam earned her PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2017. After a brief postdoc stint, Sam served as the first AAAS STPF fellow at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, where she worked in the Office of Survey Methods Research. In her role as a fellow, she worked on machine learning and data visualization projects, including Natural Language Processing problems and developing shiny apps for internal BLS use. Her other interests include network analysis and effective communication of statistics.\n\nDr. Amanda Price is an AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and began her detail in the Child Development and Behavior Branch in the NICHD in August 2019, where she manages the Cognitive Development, Behavioral Neuroscience, and Psychobiology Program. Before that, she earned a Ph.D. in Human Genetics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development in Baltimore, MD. Her work focused on measuring epigenomic and transcriptomic changes that occur during human brain development in cells isolated from postmortem brain tissue to better understand the relevant cell types and potential timing of action of genetic risk for schizophrenia, an adult-onset psychiatric disease thought to arise from perturbed developmental processes in early life.\n\nhttps://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships",

At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas--from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities--that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society. Praise for How to Be an Antiracist \"Ibram X. Kendi's new book, How to Be an Antiracist, couldn't come at a better time. . . . Kendi has gifted us with a book that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author's own path from anti-black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism. . . . How to Be an Antiracist gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, 'the basic struggle we're all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.' \"--NPR \"Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent. How to Be an Antiracist punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is--and what we should do about it.\"--Time\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "title": "Exploring Weight Loss Maintenance Through Experiments ",
    "description": "Abstract:\nI explore a theory of goal maintenance which states that individuals who achieve significant goals – such as getting out of debt, becoming sober, or losing a substantial amount of weight – are more likely to maintain the progress achieved if they frequently think about the person they were in the past, before meeting the goal, and make downward comparisons between their present self and their past, pre-goal self. In this talk, I will discuss two studies used to test this theory for weight loss maintenance, including an observational study using data from Reddit and a randomized controlled experiment using an Amazon Mechanical Turk population. I will also discuss R methods used to parse through semi-structured data, perform regression analyses and hypothesis tests, and visualize results.\n\nBio:\nElicia John is a Behavioral Data Scientist.

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Rodham (https://bookshop.org/books/rodham/9780399590917).\n\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of American Wife and Eligible, a novel that imagines a deeply compelling what-might-have-been: What if Hillary Rodham hadn't married Bill Clinton?\n\nIn 1971, Hillary Rodham is a young woman full of promise: Life magazine has covered her Wellesley commencement speech, she's attending Yale Law School, and she's on the forefront of student activism and the women's rights movement. And then she meets Bill Clinton. A handsome, charismatic southerner and fellow law student, Bill is already planning his political career. In each other, the two find a profound intellectual, emotional, and physical connection that neither has previously experienced.\n\nIn the real world, Hillary followed Bill back to Arkansas, and he proposed several times; although she said no more than once, as we all know, she eventually accepted and became Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut in Curtis Sittenfeld's powerfully imagined tour-de-force of fiction, Hillary takes a different road. Feeling doubt about the prospective marriage, she endures their devastating breakup and leaves Arkansas. Over the next four decades, she blazes her own trail--one that unfolds in public as well as in private, that involves crossing paths again (and again) with Bill Clinton, that raises questions about the tradeoffs all of us must make in building a life.\n\nBrilliantly weaving a riveting fictional tale into actual historical events, Curtis Sittenfeld delivers an uncannily astute and witty story for our times. In exploring the loneliness, moral ambivalence, and iron determination that characterize the quest for political power, as well as both the exhilaration and painful compromises demanded of female ambition in a world still run mostly by men, Rodham is a singular and unforgettable novel.\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Braiding Sweetgrass (https://www.amazon.com/Braiding-Sweetgrass-Indigenous-Scientific-Knowledge-ebook/dp/B00D0V44LC).\n\nAs a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on “a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise” (Elizabeth Gilbert).\n\nDrawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings—asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass—offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing How Charts Lie (https://www.amazon.com/How-Charts-Lie-Getting-Information/dp/1324001569).\n\nA leading data visualization expert explores the negative―and positive―influences that charts have on our perception of truth.\n\nWe’ve all heard that a picture is worth a thousand words, but what if we don’t understand what we’re looking at? Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous―and easier to share than ever. We associate charts with science and reason; the flashy visuals are both appealing and persuasive. Pie charts, maps, bar and line graphs, and scatter plots (to name a few) can better inform us, revealing patterns and trends hidden behind the numbers we encounter in our lives. In short, good charts make us smarter―if we know how to read them.\n\nHowever, they can also lead us astray. Charts lie in a variety of ways―displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns, and concealing uncertainty―or are frequently misunderstood, such as the confusing cone of uncertainty maps shown on TV every hurricane season. To make matters worse, many of us are ill-equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even our employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate them to promote their own agendas.\n\nIn How Charts Lie, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories. Public conversations are increasingly propelled by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able to decode and use visual information. By examining contemporary examples ranging from election-result infographics to global GDP maps and box-office record charts, How Charts Lie demystifies an essential new literacy, one that will make us better equipped to navigate our data-driven world.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "description": "Abstract:\nAnalysing complex sampling -- cluster samples, unequal probabilities, stratification -- used to be a separate and somewhat isolated area of statistics. Some books on the topic might have given the impression it was mostly about the care and feeding of subscripts. In fact, well-conducted complex sampling gives data with important differences from other data sources, but ones whose impact on the analysis is limited. Modern survey analysis software is aimed at reducing the differences to a minimum, so analysts and domain experts can analyse complex surveys correctly in most straightforward cases. I will talk about how you can use the R survey package to do most of the analyses you already do, but with data from complex surveys. ​\n\nBio:\nThomas Lumley is originally from Australia, but worked in Seattle, at the University of Washington, for 12 years. He is currently Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland, where he teaches statistics and data science. Thomas is the developer of the R survey package, and a member of R Core. He has taught workshops on R in 13 time zones.",

    "title": "Books In Bars - How to Lie with Maps ",
    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing How to Lie with Maps (https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Maps-Mark-Monmonier/dp/0226534219).\n\nOriginally published to wide acclaim, this lively, cleverly illustrated essay on the use and abuse of maps teaches us how to evaluate maps critically and promotes a healthy skepticism about these easy-to-manipulate models of reality. Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.\n\nThe second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.\n\nTo show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.\n\n\"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"—Scientific American\n\n\"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile.\"—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times\n\n\". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book.\"—Wilson Library Bulletin\n\n\"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense.\"—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor\n\n\"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers.\"—Jeffrey S. Murray, Canadian Geographic\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "description": "Spend Saturday evening discussing The Code Breaker (https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Code-Breaker/Walter-Isaacson/9781982115852).\n\nThe bestselling author of Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs returns with a gripping account of how Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues launched a revolution that will allow us to cure diseases, fend off viruses, and have healthier babies.\n\nWhen Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.\n\nDriven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ​a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.\n\nThe development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.\n\nShould we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?\n\nAfter helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.",

    "description": "Abstract:\nIn 2020, there was suddenly worldwide interest in graphics on a level we don't normally see - people were checking news sites daily looking for graphs, maps, and any information about how the COVID pandemic was progressing over time. Along with this, there were some very novel forms of graphics, some of which worked and many of which did not. As the pandemic continued, however, most news organizations seemed to settle on certain categories of graphics for displaying COVID case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths. Watching the pandemic and the graphics explosion that resulted, I found relatively little research into how people perceive exponential growth, and even less research into the effectiveness of log scales for conveying information. I'll talk about a series of experiments that are currently under development to explore these two topics, as well as the evolution of graphics over the course of the pandemic.\n\nBio: Susan Vanderplas is an assistant professor in the Statistics Department at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, researching the perception of statistical charts and graphs. She also works with the Center for Statistical Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) at Iowa State University, developing statistical methods for examination of bullets, cartridges, and footwear.\n\nIn her spare time (hah) she likes to sew, cross-stitch mildly off-color sayings, and bake things (usually badly).",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Lessons from Plants (https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/lessons-from-plants-beronda-l-montgomery/1137725290).\n\nAn exploration of how plant behavior and adaptation offer valuable insights for human thriving.\n\nWe know that plants are important. They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.\n\nBeronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.\n\nLessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Data Feminism (https://www.bookdepository.com/Data-Feminism-Catherine-DIgnazio/9780262044004).\n\nA new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.\n\nToday, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.\n\nIllustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”\n\nData Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..\n\nPS This book is available free online: https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/",

    "description": "This is the next event in our Tidy Tuesday series, even though it's happening on a Saturday. 😅\n\nTidy Tuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is an open-source weekly data science adventure through all things R and tidyverse. (https://www.tidyverse.org/)\n\nIn honor of Galentine's Day, we're going to gather and celebrate our R-Lady skills by having a virtual show-and-tell event using Tidy Tuesday data.\n\nYour task (if you choose to accept it) is to create a data visualization or data analysis to share with the group using the Tidy Tuesday data that is released the week of Feb. 9th (or another Tidy Tuesday data set). We'll take turns showing off our code and results.\n\nThis will be a free-flowing and fun event! (BYO Mimosas 😉) There's no pressure to bring any analysis/visualization at all, but we encourage everyone to give it a try! If you're new to R or the {tidyverse}, one of the best ways to learn is to Just Do It, as Nike says.\n\nSince this is a new type of R-Ladies DC event, we are experimenting with different times and formats until we finalize what we want these hangouts to look like.\n\nWe can't wait to see you there with all your Valentine's to the {tidyverse}! ❤️",

She has a master's degree in journalism from University of Missouri. Her journey in R coding started in 2017.\n\nAbstract:\nMost journalists complain about their CMS. So do I (shhh). When I felt confined by a CMS with limited capability of working with interactive graphics (and lack of D3 skills), Flourish came to my rescue. With built-in templates, it creates interactive maps, charts, and tables in seconds. Add a few tips and tricks to work around some of the limitations, anyone can create beautiful interactives customizable to your needs.",

    "description": "Spend Friday night discussing Algorithms of Oppression (https://www.bookdepository.com/Algorithms-Oppression-Safiya-Umoja-Noble/9781479837243).\n\nA revealing look at how negative biases against women of color are embedded in search engine results and algorithms\n\nRun a Google search for \"black girls\"-what will you find? \"Big Booty\" and other sexually explicit terms are likely to come up as top search terms. But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.\n\nIn Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.\n\nThrough an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.\n\nAn original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.\n\nPS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.",

    "title": "Introduction to R Shiny",
    "description": "Join us on **Wednesday Nov 16th at 6pm EST** for an **Introduction to R Shiny session.** Learn the basics of building interactive R data products! This instructional session will lead participants through a simple R Shiny exercise. We will build and examine the two fundamental components: the user interface and server functions. Our goal is to recognize what goes in each, how their code structures differ, and how they communicate with each other so users can directly engage with your data products.\n\nThis event is meant for people new to R Shiny, but comfortable coding ggplot graphics and writing simple functions (either custom functions or for loops).\n\nThe session will be lead by Ashton Drew, Owner and Lead Consultant at KDV Decision Analysis LLC and a certified R Shiny instructor.\n\nAshton runs a consultancy which specializes in data analytics and communication for decision support in the fields of resource management, conservation planning, and organizational development. Final products of her firm typically include data driven apps, interactive visualizations, and web-based decision support tools that allow decision-makers to simulate and compare plausible outcomes of alternative decisions. The act of making research results accessible and relevant often requires thinking beyond the science and data to consider the uncertainty and complexity of the decisions' context (e.g., fiscal realities, social values, legal requirements, etc.). To accomplish these tasks, Ashton offers skills gathering and analyzing data from databases, expert elicitations, personal narratives, and community workshops. She has worked with multiple federal, state, and private agencies to innovate and improve the science and delivery of environmental projects.\n\nPrior to starting her own business, Ashton worked as a research ecologist and instructor at North Carolina State University focused on species habitat modeling and other topics in applied landscape ecology. While there, she developed and taught several courses and co-edited two textbooks: “Predictive Species and Habitat Modeling in Landscape Ecology” and “Expert Knowledge and its Application in Landscape Ecology”. She continues to spend about a quarter of her time teaching, offering R courses through Transmitting Science (Spain) and Yukon Government (Canada).",

    "description": "Spend Tuesday evening discussing *[More than a Glitch: Confronting Race, Gender, and Ability Bias in Tech](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047654/more-than-a-glitch/)* by Meredith Broussard.\n\n**Description:**\n\n*When technology reinforces inequality, it's not just a glitch—it's a signal that we need to redesign our systems to create a more equitable world.*\n\nThe word “glitch” implies an incidental error, as easy to patch up as it is to identify. But what if racism, sexism, and ableism aren't just bugs in mostly functional machinery—what if they're coded into the system itself? In the vein of heavy hitters such as Safiya Umoja Noble, Cathy O'Neil, and Ruha Benjamin, Meredith Broussard demonstrates in *More Than a Glitch* how neutrality in tech is a myth and why algorithms need to be held accountable.\n\nBroussard, a data scientist and one of the few Black female researchers in artificial intelligence, masterfully synthesizes concepts from computer science and sociology. She explores a range of examples: from facial recognition technology trained only to recognize lighter skin tones, to mortgage-approval algorithms that encourage discriminatory lending, to the dangerous feedback loops that arise when medical diagnostic algorithms are trained on insufficiently diverse data. Even when such technologies are designed with good intentions, Broussard shows, fallible humans develop programs that can result in devastating consequences.\n\nBroussard argues that the solution isn't to make omnipresent tech more inclusive, but to root out the algorithms that target certain demographics as “other” to begin with. With sweeping implications for fields ranging from jurisprudence to medicine, the ground-breaking insights of *More Than a Glitch* are essential reading for anyone invested in building a more equitable future.",

Traditionally, statisticians have focused on the \\*average\\* effect of the treatment. However, we know that not everyone is average. Causal Forests is a powerful machine learning method used to find subgroups that have different (heterogeneous) treatment effects. For example, in a medical study patients with different health conditions may respond differently to a treatment. Causal Forests allows us to find those subgroups even when we have many different variables describing the patients and we don't know which ones are related to the treatment effect. Causal Forests can even be used to obtain a causal estimate of the treatment effect from observational (non-randomized) data. Elea will provide and overview of the algorithm and demonstrate how it can be implemented in R using the [grf](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/index.html) package. By the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of the theory and implementation of Causal Forests and be ready to apply this method to their own research.\n\n**PRIZE ANNOUNCEMENT:**\nRSVP and get entered into a raffle for a FREE eBook titled 'Tidy Modeling with R' By Max Kuhn, Julia Silge (2022). 3 winners will be chosen at the end of the workshop.

    "description": "**Abstract**: After finishing my biostats PhD 8 years ago, I started working as a machine learning engineer in the tech industry, and am now working my 4th startup job. While startups and academia do have a lot in common, startups force you to generalize (develop breadth) while other career tracks reward specialization (depth). I'll share a bit about how I've thought about building a fulfilling career as a generalist and how common themes between different application areas really make that possible!",

    "description": "This introduction to Shiny Dashboards will show users how to go from a raw data file to a working multi-Shiny app dashboard using the shinydashboard package. Topics such as interactivity, reactivity, appearance/themes, profiling, and deployment will be covered. This workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users or for those who are new to dashboard and Shiny app development; former experience with Shiny is not necessary. Some familiarity with R and/or common visualization packages such as ggplot2 would be helpful and assumed but not required, so novice users are encouraged to attend",

    "description": "Over the past several years, two technologies have undergirded many of the most innovative research projects and tools developed by the Urban Institute: the R programming language and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda. Despite their respective prevalence, R and Lambda have largely existed in isolation because Lambda does not natively support R. The presentation will describe efforts to address this barrier. The framework for running R code using AWS Lambda and examples of projects will be discussed.",
