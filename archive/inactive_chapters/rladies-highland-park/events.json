This is a fun, casual way to learn about cleaning data and creating new visualizations and to have side conversations about your favorite R topic and connect with other R-Ladies who might know how to solve that hurdle you’ve been struggling with.\n\nI’m working on wrangling beer, wine, and pizza for the event. If you have food restrictions please let me know.\n\nAlso message me to join our slack for easier communication.\n\nCan’t wait to see you all :)",
