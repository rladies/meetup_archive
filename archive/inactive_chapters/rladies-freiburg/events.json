In the R-Ladies Freiburg year-end Meetup, we'll focus on the positive things we've learned this year in R. And for this, we want to hear from you!\n\nWhether it's a cool ggplot feature, a newly discovered package, a tip for using R-Studio, or an application of familiar tools to your own project, we know you have something interesting to share! In a 10-minute slot, you can present on anything you've learned this year in R, or walk us through a visualization / piece of code that you're proud of -- all in front of an easy, helpful audience who are there to cheer you on.\n\nWe're hoping to get a range of ladies* from different areas of interest, levels of expertise, and resident countries to join and share their tips with us! If you've never presented before, we want to specifically encourage you to try it out. So don't hesitate to sign up -- we look forward to hearing from you.\n\nSo bring a mug of Glühwein (mulled wine, or your beverage of choice) and celebrate a successful year of R with us in a festive, welcoming atmosphere -- see you there!\n\nWe're happy to be joined this evening also by R-Ladies Tunisia and R-Ladies Montpellier!\n\nAnd, as a teaser, topics so far include:\n- ...how to make sweet lollipop plots\n-... small tricks to make big changes in your R-Studio experience\n\nSign up for a talk here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r3BNDPW0kkKSqd5LQNJjE8ezFblh2oOC1LcBXIxIBkc/edit",

We will explore the packages that allow us to manipulate this data into R.\nWe will finally explore the package tmap for rapidly creating beautiful and interactive maps!!\n\nIf you want also to run the code we will share consider installing the following packages before the start of the meetup:\n- ggplot2\n- tidyverse\n- raster\n- sf\n- tmap\n- tmaptools\n- rnaturalearth\n\nThe meetup will be hosted online via Zoom -- the info to enter the meetup will be sent out via Meetup shortly before the start time.

Using different R packages (including tidytext and sentimentr), we'll find positive and negative sentiments in texts, but also more detailed emotions such as surprise or fear.\n\nWe'll look at questions such as:\nCan we distinguish Shakespeare's comedies from his tragedies by looking at their sentiment scores?\nHow can we trace sentiment through chapters of a book, or lines of a play?\nWhat are frequent positive and negative words in reviews of this year's hit game Animal Crossing?\nWhich emotions are expressed in Beyoncé's and Taylor Swift's song lyrics?\n\nWe'll learn how to visualise commonly used positive and negative words in comparison clouds (an extension of word clouds) and compare approaches which only look at single words to approaches which take into account negations and other items that can influence the sentiment score.\n\nThis meetup will start with a quick review of basic text processing steps, so it's suitable for all levels and you don't need any previous experience with this topic.\n\nYou will receive a zoom link within an hour of the event starting, so check your junk mailbox shortly before the event starts if you don't have it yet!",

Using the examples of fairy tales, like the Grimm brothers collection and Alice in Wonderland, we will prepare and tokenize text data, extract the most frequent words, and display these results graphically. Then, we will explore methods for comparing more than one text source, finding words that are especially characteristic of a particular author/speaker/genre/chapter and comparing these to similar texts. After this meetup, you'll know how to compute word frequencies, identify unique word choices, calculate text-level measures such as lexical density, and create exciting visualizations of text statistics in R.\n\nR-users of all levels can get something out of this Meetup, as we will walk you through every step from reading in data to tuning the graphical parameters. The only requirement is to have R and R Studio up and running on your computer. Main packages include: tidyverse, tidytext, gutenbergr, scales. Primary source: Text Mining with R by Julia Silge.\n\nThe meetup will be hosted online via Zoom -- the link will be sent out via Meetup shortly before the start time.",

    "description": "LAST TIDY TUESDAY!!!\n\nAfter one and half month of uninterrupted weekly meetups to analyze data we are approaching the end of the Tidy Tuesday Meetings, just before the first anniversary of R-Ladies!!!\nIf you have not participated yet, do not miss this event! It is a great opportunity to meet us in an informal environment and practice your R-Skills independently of your expertise (from totally beginners to experts). And if you have been regularly coming, do not miss this last Tidy Tuesday Evening!\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nWe will use the data from Tidy Tuesday as an excuse to work with R. We will meet to work independently using the same data-set. Each one can choose which analysis to perform or which tools to use (you can already think what you want to practice or learn). We will do this together to have the opportunity to ask others and because coding together is fun!\n\nSo far the R-Ladies Freiburg have been working really hard in producing super nice plots! The idea of this meeting is to share our knowledge. You can have a look at them on:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RLadiesFreiburg\n\nThis activity is for everyone, from beginners to experts. You will set your own goal. We will have a coffee (or what ever you prefer) while working together. This way we can have the opportunity to ask others, to share ideas and code!!\n\nIt is also a great opportunity to start doing analysis to add to your portfolio on line, so that others know what you can do! Have a look at:\n\nhttps://github.com/kyla-mcconnell/tidy-tuesday\n\nhttps://github.com/ichisa/TidyTuesday\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nBring your own laptop. Hopefully with enough battery.",

For example, we might want to highlight data points that defy the overall trend, or explain what a line or colour within the graph means, or comment on and interpret the plot.\nWe'll first show you how to manually draw arrows and insert text boxes in your graph.

We'll dive into text elements like titles and labels, as well as explore the options concerning axes, legends, gridlines and the plot background in a structured way so you understand just how theme() works.\n\nThis is the first in 3 \"level up your ggplot\" meetups -- feel free to join any or all in any order.

We'll also cover adding subgroups, summaries such as averages, and spanners to group columns together.\n\nFinally, we'll take a look at the {gtsummary} package to create custom tables of descriptive statistics and learn how to export our beautiful tables in a variety of different formats.\n\n---\nIt's important to us to ensure that R-Ladies Freiburg events are a safe space for gender minorities and especially those who are just starting out with R.

    "title": "Tidy Text Analysis: Word frequencies & n-grams",
    "description": "Text is one of the most prominent and extensive data sources in the digital world. It can be an insight into consumer opinions, social media trends, and literary story arches. However, it can be difficult to analyze without specialized tools and commands. The tidytext package and framework makes it easy to go from full text files to clean data and ultimately, analysis!\n\nThe workshop will start with the building blocks of text analysis: separating a text into smaller chunks, removing punctuation, and identifying frequent words or phrases. If you’ve joined our previous text analysis meetups before, this will be a great recap; if you haven’t, this will bring you right up to speed! We’ll show you all you need to know so beginners to the topic are very much welcome.\n\nThe focus for the evening will be on going beyond individual words in isolation to n-grams: units of a set number of words (e.g. bigrams like “I think”, “think that”, “that tidytext”, “tidytext is”, “is great”.). This will allow us to get a sense of context about words based on the company they keep and address typical text analysis problems (e.g. \"happy\" preceded by \"not\" being given a positive sentiment score).\n\nWe’ll top it all off with some truly unique visualizations that show the relationship between words, like bigram network plots with ggraph. Materials will be based on the book Tidy Text Mining by Julia Silge and David Robinson (chapter 4).",

    "description": "R-Ladies Toolbox Series - Essentials for women and minority genders in academia, science and data analysis presents:\nPanel discussion on women in science\n\nTo finish this series about women in science we will discuss about the inequities and problems that women and gender minorities find in academia. We will talk about systemic issues, non-visible barriers and work, family and care. What problems do we face? Are politics to increase gender equality effective? Is there data to support these measurements and decisions? We count with a grate panel of women and we invite you too to share your own perspectives!\n\nPanellists:\n\nDaloha Rodriguez-Molina\ncomes from Venezuela. She studied medicine and practiced as a primary care, emergency, and occupational physician. She has been involved in research activities since 2008 as part of the Student Society for the Promotion of Research in Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, of which she was President in 2011. She obtained a Master's degree in Epidemiology from the University of Munich (LMU) in 2016. Currently, she is an occupational and environmental epidemiologist and pursuing a PhD degree in Epidemiology at the LMU under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Katja Radon. She has been involved in teaching activities at the LMU Munich, the Virtual University of Baviera, and the Center for International Health of the LMU .

She holds two degrees in Education and Social Pedagogy, and is completing a postgraduate diploma in \"Data Science: Machine Learning and its Applications\" at the University of Córdoba, Argentina. She teaches programming and robotics for children and teenagers. She worked as a data scientist at an online platform, analysing data from a social and educational point of view. She attended many conferences regarding data in Latin America and realized that no one was talking about gender bias, gender data and feminism. So Ivana decided to create \"DataGénero\" a gender data Observatory, the first in the region with a group of scientists, activists and people from different disciplines and countries. https://datagenero.org\n\nKamila Benadrouche\nholds a master’s degree in operational research: optimization and strategic management. Economic studies engineer at sonatrach. Previously teaching programming tools and R language at the university of Boumerdes, Algeria. Founder of R-Ladies Algiers and organizer of the meetups for the promotion of R. And freelance trainer of Office-Tools (Word, Excel…).\n\nLiili Abuladze\nis a social demography PhD researcher at Tallinn University, Estonia. Her research interests include population ageing outcomes, fertility and family formation, and data quality. In 2020, she was awarded with the European Association for Population Studies Outreach Award for communication activities in demography. She is also the initiator and co-organiser of the R-Ladies Tbilisi community.\n\nMasani Mahadik\nMajoring in econometrics and completing post graduate programs in statistics, and business management, Manasi has been applying R in an academic setting across a variety of disciplines. She has worked in advanced analytics consulting at Nielsen for a couple of years where she comprehensively used R to conduct a range of data play and visualisations in order to deliver insights for Top FMCG clients across the South Asia region. She is currently pursuing a fellowship in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and aims to make the next move in the social sector — using data for good! She leads the R-Ladies Mumbai chapter, and blogs about her explorations with data. You can connect with her: https://www.linkedin.com/in/manasi-mahadik-a66b26146/\n\nThis series is funded by the “Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg”, the University of Education in Freiburg. Everyone is welcome to join and we hope for a warm exchange between students, researchers and R-Ladies.",

Make sure that you have your GitLab account ready.\nHere is the link to the get started page with some useful information including how to set up an account:\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github\nAlso here is a short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_XsJIHSLRg\n\nSpeaker Bio: At the end of her studies of biosystem engineering Christin decided to change from Excel to R for her diploma thesis. Since then she is using R in her daily research, first as a PhD student in basic cancer research in Berlin, nowadays as bioinformatics scientist in pharmaceutical company in Toulouse France. Right after her PhD she founded R-Ladies Berlin and supported the R-Ladies global team until last year. After some abstinence She is happy to be back in the community and is looking forward to meet up with you.\n\nCalling all students, academics, and women in science! R-Ladies Freiburg presents a five-part guest series aimed at women and gender minorities in academia, science and data analysis, from first semester students to tenured researchers. Leading R-Ladies from around the world will lead us through the most fundamental steps to studying and working in academia, from analyzing results, to presenting them clearly, ensuring their reproducibility, and keeping track of all your changes. The series will close with a panel discussion from women around the world, who will speak about their experiences with science.\n\nThis series is funded by the “Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg”, the University of Education in Freiburg.\n\nParticipants who take part in all five meetups can receive a certificate of participation.\n\nEveryone is welcome to join and we hope for a warm exchange between students and researchers, as well as R-Ladies from the wider community.",

    "title": "{R-Ladies Toolbox Series} Part 3: Reproducibility ",
    "description": "R-Ladies Toolbox Series - Essentials for women and minority genders in academia, science and data analysis presents:\n\nReproducibility by Charles Grey (R-Ladies Remote)\n\nTalk Abstract:\nAs scientists, it's desirable to demonstrate to others (including our future selves) that our computational scientific work validates the claims we make in published research. Being able to reproduce the work is a key component of easily validating an analysis, as well as extending the work. Reproducibility is not as simple, however, as sharing the code and data that produced our analysis. We must consider how our data and algorithms are understood, variables defined, etc. Our code needs to be accessible and interoperable. There is much guidance about best practice, but this is often overwhelming for those of us who are not from formal computer science training. In this talk I share the story of how I attempted good enough practice in my doctoral thesis, and found even this was simply too much to achieve. Indeed, despite failing to achieve good enough scientific practice in any aspect of reproducibility, I discovered a delightful world of scientific workflows in R that make every day just that bit easier now. Failing at reproducible science in R is the best we can aim for; we will never achieve best practice in every aspect of reproducibility, and if we failed, then we tried. Through this process we discover useful tools to make the next time easier.\n\nBIO:\nCharles T. Gray is a postdoc with the evidence synthesis lab at Newcastle University. She is currently specialising in Bayesian network meta-analysis in Cochrane intervention reviews. She has three degrees: arts, music, and mathematics. None of these prepared her for her interdisciplinary computational metascience doctoral thesis in R.\n\nCalling all students, academics, and women in science! R-Ladies Freiburg presents a five-part guest series aimed at women and gender minorities in academia, science and data analysis, from first semester students to tenured researchers.

    "description": "R-Ladies Toolbox Series - Essentials for women and minority genders in academia, science and data analysis presents:\n\nPresenting Results by Manasi Mahadik (R-Ladies Mumbai)\n\n--> A tryst with tabular data : Exploring the gt package in R <--\n\nThe tidyverse is undisputed royalty within the R universe and is arguably the most comprehensible toolset in dealing with structured data out there. Ggplot2, the tidyverse’s data visualisation package, based on the Grammar of Graphics upon its release in 2005 has been one of the main reasons for its super stardom primarily because of its absolute ease in allowing the user to add, remove or alter components in a plot at a high level of abstraction. The success of the package set the stage for a package to make creating tabular representations as easy. Short for “grammar of tables,\" the goal of gt is similar to that of ggplot2, serving to not just to make it effortless to make specific tables, but to describe a set of underlying components that can be recombined in different ways to solve different problems. All of this with tidyverse’s API makes the syntax simple to grasp for existing users, leading to a beautiful “camera-ready” output within minutes.\n\nThis talk aims to walk the attendees through a typical gt workflow —\nTidy Data —> GT Object —> GT Table, and then syntactically build the various components of a table I.e. the table header, the stub, the column labels and spanner column labels, the table body, and the table footer. In order to make its implementation as holistic as possible , the incorporation of ggplot2 plots inside the gt package will also be demonstrated. Although the workshop will be conducted on an inbuilt R dataset, attendees are free to use any tidy dataset during the workshop. R users of all levels are welcome!\n\n--> Bio<--\n\nMajoring in econometrics and completing post graduate programs in statistics, and business management, Manasi has been applying R in an academic setting across a variety of disciplines. Professionally, she has worked in advanced analytics consulting at Nielsen for a couple of years where she comprehensively used R to conduct a range of data play and visualisations in order to deliver impact oriented insights for Top FMCG clients across the South Asia region. She is currently pursuing a fellowship in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and aims to make the next move in the social sector — using data for good! She also leads the R-Ladies Mumbai chapter, and regularly blogs about her explorations with data.

    "description": "'Mastering Shiny' takes time and practice! Join R-Ladies Freiburg for an evening of data wrangling, plotting, and ultimately putting it all together into your own Pride-themed data dashboard.\n\nFor this workshop, we'll use a great dataset on \"rainbow capitalism\" from Tidy Tuesday and Data for Progress:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2022/2022-06-07\n\nDescription from Data for Progress, quoted by TT:\nEach year, hundreds of corporations around the country participate in Pride, an annual celebration of the LGBTQ+ community’s history and progress. They present themselves as LGBTQ+ allies, but new research from Data for Progress finds that in between their yearly parade appearances, dozens of these corporations are giving to state politicians behind some of the most bigoted and harmful policies in over a decade.\n\nWe'll take a look at the data, wrangle it into the right format, find a fitting graph, and make the whole thing into an interactive plot in a Shiny dashboard -- all with plenty of chances to try things on your own (or watch some live coding if you prefer!)\n\nIf you're just getting started with Shiny, we recommend checking out the recordings of our previous workshops on the topic:\nBasics incl. input and output - https://youtu.be/gk73bLmteP0\nBasic plots - https://youtu.be/Bb5Xol1oU_I\nEurovision example - https://youtu.be/UGTTqhxaICU",

We’ll also mention how you can use Quarto for other programming languages such as Python and Julia and how to use it within code editors like VS Code.\n\nYou'll be able to download and try Quarto for yourself and try it out along with our demonstrations — so you can decide for yourself if you’d like to add it to your toolbox!\n\nYou can find more information on Quarto on https://quarto.org/",

The result can be exported (\"knitted\") to several kinds of documents including html and pdf files.\nR Markdown also saves you a lot of the hassle of typical word processors because a lot of the formatting is consistently handled for you. Beyond that, R Markdown files help make research more reproducible so that you can easily handle modifications, additional data or analyses.\n\nNo previous knowledge of R Markdown is assumed. We start the workshop by discussing the typical structure of an R Markdown document, show you how to effortlessly format text and code blocks, and include images and links. Then, we take a look at slides and, finally, articles (including references and a bibliography) with R Markdown.\n\nImage by Allison Horst (https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).\nAlt-text: A glam rock band comprised of 3 fuzzy round monsters labeled as “Text”, “Outputs” and “Code” performing together. Stylized title text reads: “R Markdown - we’re getting the band back together.”",

We will use different Tidy Tuesday datasets including spatial information and recreate maps that you may have seen on social media. These include scatter maps, bubble maps and choropleth maps. To ease the start into the topic of creating maps with R, we will use {ggplot2}, a package most of you will be familiar with.\nYou will have the chance to practice your skills in several exercises. One of these will be a map in which you can provide your geolocation and appear as a dot on a world map that’ll show how global R-Ladies Freiburg has become.\nThe workshop will be given by our guest speaker Beke Hansen. Beke is a sociolinguist working at the University of Kiel and a long-time fan and member of R-Ladies Freiburg.\n\nNote: We will not be recording this workshop, so be sure to attend on the day of the event if you are interested!

    "description": "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical (and sometimes under-appreciated!) step that precedes statistical analysis. This includes steps like calculating descriptive statistics, finding extreme values, and summarizing the data -- in general, getting familiar with your raw data before you start to apply a statistical model! In this workshop, we will use dplyr (tidyverse) commands, like group_by() and summarize(), to highlight these important EDA steps.\n\nEDA also includes graphing raw data to assess initial trends. The workshop will also cover different kinds of data visualisations, including box plots, scatterplots with trend lines, and bar plots with the ggplot package. The focus will be on quickly deploying informative graphs and selecting the right geom()s for the data types you have.\n\nNo previous knowledge is assumed, just general experience with R (loading packages, reading in data, etc.). If you'd like to polish up your tidyverse skills before joining, check out our previous workshop on data wrangling: https://youtu.be/NRgdTaAfwTo",

Feel free to take a look at our video that covers these tasks: https://youtu.be/NO6ikdBxSwg\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nIt's important to us to ensure that R-Ladies Freiburg events are a safe space for anyone of a minority gender, specifically including transgender, gender non-conforming and nonbinary people as well as folks questioning their gender. All are welcome at this meetup but we specifically ask cisgender men to take a passive role and hold comments / questions until after others have had the chance to ask. Thank you for your support!",
