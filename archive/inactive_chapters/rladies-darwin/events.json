    "description": "I'm excited to be combining our next meetup with R-Ladies Melbourne! We will hear from Dr Emi Tanaka about her new package called \"edibble\". A big thankyou to the organisers for letting us tag along.\n\nAnalysing data is unimaginable without a statistical software. Anyone who requires statistical computing on a regular basis would frequently interact with a statistical software and therefore the interface design can have a radical effect on the masses. In this talk, I will dive into a range of programming paradigms with relation to the interface design of software. I will then discuss in-depth about a novel computational framework, called the \"grammar of experimental design\", and its implementation as the edibble R-package.\n\nBiography\nDr. Emi Tanaka is a lecturer in statistics at Monash University whose primary interest is to develop impactful statistical methods and tools that can readily be used by practitioners. Her research area include data visualisation, mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She is currently the President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victorian Branch and is an avid programmer in R, HTML/CSS and other computational languages.\n\nZoom link to be provided closer to the date.",

I am thrilled to announce that R-Ladies Darwin is launching on Thursday the 9th of September!\n\nYou are all invited to give a lightning talk about ANYTHING related to R, including but not limited to:\n\n-Your past experience of using R;\n-Your favourite packages;\n-Something that you want to learn but don't know where to start with;\n-Useful channels to learn R;\netc. etc.\n\n(Note you don't have to give a talk.)\nThese will be informal talks and we are really friendly people, so don't be stressed! I would recommend keeping your talk short and concise, 5-10 minutes will be perfect.
