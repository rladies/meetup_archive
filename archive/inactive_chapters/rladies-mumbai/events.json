    "description": "Highcharter is a R wrapper for Highcharts javascript library and its modules. Highcharts is very mature and flexible javascript charting library and it has a great and powerful API.\n\nThe Highcharter package in R with it’s navigable nature, graspable syntax and advanced D3JS visuals is a great addition to the R viz space, currently dominated by the Grammar of graphics ggplot2 package.\n\nIt can be used to create the a wide range of charts like bubble charts, column charts, tree maps, time series graphs etc using similar syntax and arguments.\n\nNot only does it support R objects but also employs the loved %>% 'pipe’ operator making it seem incredibly familiar to tidyverse users. This homely syntax combined with stunning visuals makes it go-to tool in R shiny apps and R markdown documents.\n\nThis will be a hands-on session and we will be creating basic visuals together in the workshop.\n\nAttendees must have the 'Highcharter' package installed on R-Studio to actively participate in the workshop!\nLook forward to e-meeting you all!",
