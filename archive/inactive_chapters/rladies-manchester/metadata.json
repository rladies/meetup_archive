  "description": "<p>R-Ladies Manchester is part of a global initiative, R-Ladies Global, designed to improve the gender diversity of R users worldwide and in particular, to improve the participation and experience of women in the R community. As part of the initiative, R-Ladies Manchester will host a number of talks and workshops about the use of R. It doesn't matter if you never used R or if you are an R expert, R-Ladies Manchester welcomes anyone with an interest in R. The goal is to promote R, exchange knowledge and create an R community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as female who is interested in and/or working with R.<\/p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesManchest\">@RladiesManchester<\/a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal\">@RLadiesGlobal<\/a>, and on Github at <a>github.com/RLadiesManchester<\/a><\/p>\n<br>",
