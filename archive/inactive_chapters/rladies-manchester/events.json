    "description": "R-Ladies Manchester is ready to announce our first event!\n\nR-Ladies Manchester is part of a global initiative, R-Ladies Global, designed to improve the gender diversity of R users worldwide and in particular, to improve the participation and experience of women in the R community. As part of the initiative, R-Ladies Manchester will host a number of talks and workshops about the use of R. It doesn't matter if you never used R or if you are an R expert, R-Ladies Manchester welcomes anyone with an interest in R. The goal is to promote R, exchange knowledge and create an R community among women. We are fully inclusive and respectful of LGBT identities - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as female who is interested in and/or working with R.\n\nWe will begin our first workshop by reinforcing the foundations of your data analysis knowledge and R skills, and then move on to creating reproducible reports using R Markdown. The workshop starts with some warm-ups to get your brain in R-mode, and to make sure the basics are covered. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises, you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R: basic use of the R/RStudio console, inputting and importing different data types, record keeping, graphs etc. It concludes by showing how to create reproducible R Markdown documents. You might wish to bring your own laptop!\n\nTo gain an insight in the members’ competence and interest in R, we kindly ask you to answer our short survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10yy1MouWOCpvrBdygFZZFwg8MoS4xwkLtPeXoGjuNw0/edit?c=0&w=1) and to spread the word about our group.\n\nWe are on Tweeter: @RLadiesManchest and on GitHab: RLadiesManchester\n\nWe hope you will join us!",

There will be a couple of talks on:\n\n* Using git with R\n* Getting started with making R packages If there are any topics you'd like to cover or have an interesting talk to give then we'd love to hear from you. In January we will be organising a hackathon so we can also use this session to discuss ideas for this. It's Manchester R ladies 1st birthday! There will be cake. - We have the room booked for a couple of hours but we can move to a cafe/Xmas markets after the talks for a hot chocolate to go with the cake.\n\n• What to bring\nThe sessions will probably be quite interactive so bring a laptop to follow along. Also bring along an R function that can be put into a package (this can be as simple as the HelloWorld function!)",

    "description": "Meet the drivers!\nSocium Recruitment are generously sponsoring this event, so of course, we invited them to come and introduce themselves. They'll be there on the night if you're in the job market.\n\n“With a name taken from the Latin for ‘partner’ – and good solid Northern roots – people are at the heart of everything we do. Sure, qualifications and experiences are vital pieces of the picture – hey with a background in software development, we’re well-versed in the importance of just the right skillset – but ultimately, placing the perfect candidate in the perfect job is also about personality, cultural fit and ambition.\n\nAs such, we’re looking forward to placing people at the heart of every data science project we are involved in. From the people looking for just the right talent to help their team grow, to the people looking for the next digital role to get their teeth into, our approach will be relationship-led, face-to-face wherever possible, and packed with a healthy dose of Northern straight-talking. If you’re searching for the impossible, we’ll tell you. But if you’re just searching for the really, really hard-to-find – well, we’ll be able to help.”\n\nFirst gear!\nFor our first event for a little while, we will be running an introduction to R presentation, covering things like installing R, loading up your first dataset and using your first packages, with hands on help to really get you moving.\n\nRevving up!\nOnce we've whet your appetite, there'll be lightning talks from ladies who use R for some more advanced applications, to really inspire you to keep learning! Here's some more information on them:\n\nRachel Tadd\n\nRachel is an Operational Research Analyst by profession and a data lover by nature. With a background in mathematics, probability and statistics, she enjoys both the theory and the application of data analysis. Rachel has over seven years of R experience and is proud to be a Manchester R-Lady.\n\nTalk synopsis:\nR is for Resources. Rachel Tadd will talk about the wide variety of online resources available to help you learn R, improve your R and troubleshoot your R problems. As well as the usual Q&A, the talk will be followed by an opportunity to share your favourite resources so please bring details with you.\n\nNaomi Ball (@NaomiJBall)\n\nNaomi Ball is a mathematician and operational research professional in the Civil Service. She’s a fan of reproducible workflows, data visualisation and storytelling with data.\n\nTalk synopsis:\nRShiny - build your first interactive dashboard\nTaking you through all the code needed to build a simple app to explore your data.\n\nHit the brakes!\nThere'll be chance to network with some light food and drinks. We will also be providing a quiet space you are welcome to use, to give you the chance to absorb everything you'll have learned and mingle at your own pace.\n\nCongratulations, you've passed!\nAttending this event means that you have read, understand and are happy to adhere to our code of conduct, found here: https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct",
