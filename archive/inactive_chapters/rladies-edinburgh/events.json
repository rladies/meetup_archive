    "description": "We are super pleased to invite you to our workshop \"Introduction to Bayesian Statistical Modelling using brms\". In this two-day workshop, we will learn some basics about Bayesian statistics, with a focus on using a Bayesian approach to statistical modelling. We will use brms package by Paul Bürkner, which uses Stan.\n\nOn the first day, we will have an intro to Bayesian statistics and statistical modelling. We will be introduced to brms using simple variants of the general linear model, and multi-level models, with a normal response distribution.\n\nOn the second day, we will take a look at the binomial and Poisson distribution for count data, and learn when we should used them and how to do so using brms.\n\nThe workshop will have small lectures and some practical exercises so the participants can fit their own models with brms.\n\nThis workshop will be facilitated by Marie Beisemann. She's about to start her Phd in Statistics at the Technical University of Dortmund, Germany, right after finishing he Master's degree in psychology at the University of Münster. She's (really) passionate about sharing her knowledge about brms and Bayes with us, and we're super excited to have her here!\n\nP. S., if you will attend this workshop, we really need you to install brms beforehand.",

    "description": "For our April meetup we're so very lucky to have Julia Silge join us! Julia is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio where she works on open-source modeling tools. She is also the co-author of Tidy Text Mining with R (tidytextmining.com). Julia is keynoting at satRdays Newcastle on April 4, and passing through Edinburgh on her way there. We recommend checking out newcastle2020.satrdays.org for a great, nearby R event as well!\n\n**Understand word embeddings using tidy data principles**\n\nModern NLP frameworks often depend on word embeddings, a way of statistically modeling language where words or phrases are mapped to vectors of real numbers. In this talk, we’ll work to understand word embeddings by investigating how we can generate them using count-based statistics and dimensionality reduction, then learn how to make use of pre-trained embeddings based on enormous datasets. Finally, we’ll explore the ethical issues involved in using word embeddings and how they can amplify systemic and historical bias.\n\n--\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend this event?\nA: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor. Please contact mine@rladies.org if you have questions.***\n\nAdditionally, please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.",

    "description": "**UPDATE** We are moving this event online, at the same time and day. We will send a Zoom link for the call day prior to the event. Hope you can join us online!\n\nDr. Erin LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, where she leads the development of an open-source, automatic machine learning (AutoML) platform. Before joining H2O.ai, she worked as a data scientist and software engineer and founded DataScientific, Inc. She’s also the founder of the non-profit Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS.org) organization and co-founder of the R-Ladies Global organization. She received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley where her research focused on machine learning and statistical computing.\n\n**Scalable Automatic Machine Learning in R with H2O**\n\nThe focus of this presentation is scalable and automatic machine learning in R using the H2O machine learning platform. H2O is an open-source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning, followed by a detailed look inside H2O’s AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface that automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a “leaderboard” of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production. R code examples are available on GitHub for participants to follow along on their laptops.\n\n--\n\nQ: Are men welcome to attend this event?\nA: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

By the end of the workshop, you will be able to see if you tweet mostly positive or negative content, and you will be able to plot the most frequent words in a wordcloud. Don't worry if you do not have your own Twitter account - there will be an alternative provided.\n\nAnna Henschel is a third year PhD candidate at the University of Glasgow, where she conducts research in the Social Brain in Action Lab on the ERC-funded Social Robots project. She has a B.Sc. in Psychology from Konstanz University and a M.Sc. cum laude from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in Cognitive Neuropsychology. Her feminist activism and work as a STEM ambassador was recently honoured with the YWCA 30 Under 30 Inspirational Women Scotland award. She uses R in her PhD and also just for fun.\n\nYou can find her on Twitter (@AnnaHenschel) and check out the workshop Twitter account (@beautiful_hack).",

We'll start off with a brief introduction to rstudio::global(2021) and then watch Kara's rstudio::global talk \"Always look on the bright side of plots\" followed by a live Q&A with Kara! Zoom password will be sent out the day of the event.\n\nAlways look on the bright side of plots\nEveryone who creates visualizations in R is bound to make mistakes that prevent their plots from looking as they should. Sometimes, these mistakes create beautiful \"accidental aRt\", though other times they're just plain frustrating. Either way, however, there's something to be learned. This talk will draw on years of watching both the ggplot2 issue tracker and the @accidental__aRt Twitter account to highlight some common plot foibles and explain what they can teach us about how ggplot2 works.\n\nrstudio::global is a free, virtual event on all things R & RStudio.\nIt's hosted over 24-hours – giving people at different timezones a number of options to conveniently engage – with a number of talks and community-engagement events we hope you'll enjoy. It starts on January 21 at 4:00 PM GMT.

By combining narrative text, code, images, and tables, Quarto allows you to produce elegantly formatted output that is fully reproducible. Quarto is capable of embedding code written in R, Python, Julia, and Observable JS (for this talk we’ll focus on R). It supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, slides, dashboards, scientific articles and more.\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss what Quarto is and how it differs from R Markdown, demonstrate how to make simple documents, and showcase a few features of Quarto that make it incredibly useful. In this session, you will learn how to:\n\n* create documents in Quarto that combine R code with text, images, and plots.\n* make use of Quarto options to easily switch between output formats such as PDF, MS Word, and HTML\n* parameterise reports to quickly create multiple copies of a report\n\n\\*\\*Please bring a laptop so you can fully participate in the workshop.\\*\\*\n\nAfter the workshop, we will have ample time for networking and chat over some snacks and drinks (courtesy of the Software Sustainability Institute).\n\n*Nicola is a Lecturer in Health Data Science, based at Lancaster University.*",

We will also consider how best to visualise the outputs of our clustering. The session will focus on the example of energy inequalities in Greater London, but the technique has a wide range of application areas across different disciplines and sectors. After an introduction to the technique, you will have time to have a go of the clustering yourself.

However, developing an understanding of SQL gives us an edge when working with big data, as we can connect to databases directly from R, pulling in only the bits that we need for analysis and saving memory. SQL can also be used to efficiently perform simple data manipulation tasks like sorting, filtering, and aggregation on large datasets, which would take significant computational resources in R.\n\nIn this RLadies workshop we will run through some basic SQL queries that can be used to retrieve and filter tables from databases, and learn a little bit about how relational databases work. We will then look at how to write and run SQL queries directly from R, and some use cases for this.\n\nIn order to fully participate in this workshop, please make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your laptop, and make sure you have the package ‘DBI’ installed by running \\`install.packages(\"DBI\")\\` before the workshop.

    "title": "Flipping Tables: Creating Tables with {gt} in R",
    "description": "Data visualization is a fundamental tool in any data science tool kit. Graphs and plots are often synonymous with data visualization, though are not the only means of presenting or visualizing data. In this workshop we will be exploring the often-overlooked side of data visualization: tables. Join us at R Ladies Edinburgh to \\*flip the table\\* on data visualization and learn how to create stunning, customizable tables in R using the {gt} package. During the workshop, you will be introduced to {gt} and the philosophy behind the package, gain insights into what it can do as well as have the opportunity to experiment and create your own tables.\n\nPlease bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed so that you can fully participate in the workshop. If you do not already have the package installed, you can install {gt} on your system by using \\`install.packages(“gt”)\\` ahead of the workshop.\n\nAfter the workshop, we will have ample time for networking and chatting over some snacks and drinks (courtesy of the Software Sustainability Institute).\n\n*Dr Brittany Blankinship is a Lecturer in Data Science at the University of Edinburgh as part of the Data-Driven Innovation initiative in Health and Social Care at the Usher Institute. She is passionate about many things including tackling the stigma around learning/teaching statistics and coding (it can be fun!), data visualization and data storytelling, and most importantly R.*",
