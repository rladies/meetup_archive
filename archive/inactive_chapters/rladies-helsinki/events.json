But don’t let this overwhelm you! The aim of this session is to introduce you to the relevant concepts, as we will touch upon the most important of them rather than diving into details. Even if you don’t fully understand what you are doing during the session, you will hopefully leave with a different perspective on how you can organise your code (for yourself or others) and gear up with the needed resources for the next time you want to reproduce these steps more seriously.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Bring your own laptop!\n- (Optional) Rstudio installed; this is not necessary to produce R packages but it does make your life easier as the main package for R package development, devtools, is well integrated with RStudio.\n- The following R packages:\n- devtools, usethis and roxygen2\n- tidyverse, rlang\n- (optional) drat\n- ... if I have forgotten something, we will install it on the spot.\n- A GitHub account. I could list this also as optional, but if you want the full experience from this second half of the session, it’s good to reproduce the steps yourself. You are of course welcome either way.\n- A travis account (go to travis-ci.com and sign up with GitHub; this prerequisite assumes you already have a GitHub account)\n\nProgram:\n18.00 Welcome\n18.10 Maria Kalimeri, \"Writing sharable R code.\"\n19.30 Questions and mingle\n20.00 Closing the event",

    "description": "DevOps for Data Science or\nHow to build a data pipeline that is not a giant house of cards built from random scripts that will all completely collapse the moment any input does anything weird (see https://xkcd.com/2054/)\n\nWe’ve all heard the saying about the 80-20 rule in data science, that most of the project time is spent on wrangling the data in to correct format and only a fraction on the actual model building. The truth is actually even worse: there’s also the effort needed to make sure your model will not explode when left to run on its own in production – or to make sure you will notice when it does.\n\nThat’s where DevOps comes in. In this talk Seija Sirkiä will introduce basic concepts like version control and CI/CD (continuous integration, continuous development) and attempt to do this from the perspective and to an audience of data scientists (maybe particularly those who use R and RStudio). This is not a lesson in exact tools but more a plea for a change in attitude. It is true that we are not software engineers and we don’t exactly produce software but a big part of our daily troubles are the same.\n\nProgram:\n18.00 Welcome !\n18.10 Seija Sirkiä and DevOps for Data Science\n19.10 Mingle and questions\n20.00 Closing the event\n\nPlace: Houston Analytics, Konepajankuja 1",
