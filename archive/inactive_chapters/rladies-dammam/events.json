The Amazing Maya Gans will give an overview of how javascript is used in R with a brief intro to Shiny app.\n\nThinking of looking at Shiny under the hood? Through using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this talk will go through helpful use cases to empower you to start customising Shiny. Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. It's very easy to write and it is not surprising to see Shiny apps popping up in all manner of applications including healthcare and medical applications.\n\nWHO is this for?\n- If you never worked with Shiny and want to understand how it is used?\n- If you love Shiny app and want to understand more about how it's customised.\n- Both beginners and experienced R users are welcome to join!\n\nAGENDA\n7:30–7:35 pm Who we are | Announcement about useR Conference 2021\n7:35–8:25 pm A Little JS Goes a Long Way\n8:25–8:30 pm Any Qs?\n\nOur speaker, Maya Gans is an experienced R and JavaScript developer, who recently started applying those skills to the clinical trial space. After graduating with her Masters in Botany from the University of Wyoming, Maya interned at RStudio where she created a blocks based programming language called tidyblocks, as well as co-authoring “JavaScript for Data Science”. Currently, Maya writes R packages and Shiny applications to create dynamic, custom data visualisation and exploratory tools to aid in understanding complex data. Maya is also passionate about data science education and has given many talks and workshops about using and creating tools in R.\n\nYou can find out more about Maya Gans here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mayacelium\nWebsite:https://maya.rbind.io/\n\nPlace: Zoom- https://zoom.us/download - The event will not be recorded.\nWe will send you the Zoom link & the passcode via email a few hours before the meetup.

    "title": "Why R for legal backgrounds?",
    "description": "**This is will be an interactive session where participants who have no background in R are strongly encouraged to attend and participants with backgrounds in R, but no legal background, are also strongly encouraged to attend.**\n\nThe presenter will share an ongoing project currently underway during a mentorship through Open Life Sciences (OLS). The project aims to create an open educational resource demonstrating the “why” for people from legal backgrounds who might want to learn R. It is partly a case for open and reproducible research in a field that does not typically use R and quantitative methods. The project also involves creating different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a single platform with a few examples of practical use and application as well as code.\n\n**This event is a joint meeting between R-Ladies Dammam and R-Ladies Johannesburg, you can register on either page.**\n\nWe will design this session as a mix of demo, silent reflections and group discussions to bring diverse perspectives into the conversation. We will use a shared document for collaborative notetaking and capturing feedback and learnings also from those who cannot or prefer not to speak during the session.\n\n**WHO is this for?**\n\n* Individuals who have no background in R.\n* Individuals who background in R, but no legal background.\n* Both beginners and experienced R users are welcome to join!\n\n**AGENDA**\n5:30–6:00 pm Talk by Biandri Joubert\n6:00–6:20 pm Breakout rooms\n6:20–6:30 pm Discussion and wrap up\n\n**The Speaker:**\nBiandri is a researcher in the field of international trade law and has recently submitted her PhD thesis for marking. She will defend her thesis later in the year. She started her research with a purely legal (doctrinal) research background before transitioning to a mixed methodology PhD research project which included a content analysis using R programming. The difficulty in finding resources that were relatable to a legal academic background prompted the design of her Open Life Sciences (OLS) project. She is currently based in Johannesburg where she conducts both academic research and research/consulting in the private sector. When not writing/researching, she is most likely fly fishing or talking about fly fishing.\n\n**Place: Zoom- https://zoom.us/download - The event will not be recorded.**\nWe will send you the Zoom link & the passcode via email a few hours before the meetup. Please check out your email later.\nWe look forward to welcoming you!\n\n**If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us :**\n#LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/r-ladies-saudi-arabia-dammam/\n#Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dammam/\n#Twitter: https://twitter.com/RLadiesDammam",
