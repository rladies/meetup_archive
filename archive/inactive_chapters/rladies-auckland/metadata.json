  "description": "<p>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Auckland exists to promote diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.<\/p>\n<p>R-Ladies Auckland welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. <\/p>\n<p>@RLadiesALK (twitter) | auckland [at] rladies.org (email) | <a href=\"https://github.com/R-LadiesAKL\"><\/a>https://github.com/R-LadiesAKL/meetup-presentations_auckland (GitHub)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p><span>PS Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct: <\/span> <br><\/p>\n<p><i>the leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). R-Ladies Auckland have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we therefore reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deem appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Auckland is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. <\/i> <br><\/p>\n<p>Full community guidelines are found here: <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki..\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p>\n<p>PPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: <\/p>\n<p><i>photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Auckland event you grant the community organisers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
