  "description": "<p>R-Ladies Perth welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community! <br>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Perth exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. <br>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news! <br><br><\/p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.rladies.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rladies.org<\/a> <br><br><\/p>\n<p>Twitter: @RLadiesGlobal ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal<\/a> ) <br><br><\/p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies<\/a> <br><br><\/p>\n<p><i>PS Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct: <br>The leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Perth is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. <br><br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i><b>Full community guidelines are found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki<\/a> <\/b><br><br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>PPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: <br>Photos, Films, and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Perth event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
