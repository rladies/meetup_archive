  "description": "<p>R-Ladies Newcastle welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p> <br>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Newcastle exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>We are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account and follow us on twitter to stay up to date about R-Ladies news! <br> <br><\/p>\n<p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesNCL\">@RLadiesNCL<\/a> | Email: <a href=\"mailto:newcastle@rladies.org\">newcastle@rladies.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><br><\/p>\n<p><span>Twitter:<\/span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal\">@RLadiesGlobal<\/a>&nbsp;| Website: <a href=\"https://www.rladies.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rladies.org<\/a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<br> <br><\/p>\n<p> <br><\/p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies<\/a> <br> <br><\/p>\n<p><b>Sponsorship<\/b><\/p>\n<p>R-Ladies Newcastle has been sponsored by Sticker Mule, so we'll soon be handing out some excellent stickers!

Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Newcastle is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team. <br> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>Full community guidelines are found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki<\/a> <br> <br><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i>PPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: <br>Photos, Films, and all other media/recordings: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community. By taking part in an R-Ladies Newcastle event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community’s aims.
