  "description": "This is a local chapter of R-Ladies Global (https://www.rladies.org), an organisation that promotes gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools.\n\nR-Ladies welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!\n\nWe are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world. You can access our presentations, R scripts, and Projects on our Github account (https://github.com/rladies) and follow us on Mastodon (https://hachyderm.io/@RLadiesGlobal) to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!\n\nMake sure you read and comply with our code of conduct (https://rladies.org/coc/) and community guidelines (https://guide.rladies.org/about/mission/#r-ladies-rules--guidelines).\n\nPlease note that by taking part in an R-Ladies event you grant the community organizers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the community's aims.
