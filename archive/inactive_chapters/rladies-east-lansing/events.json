Prior to joining RStudio, Dr. Hill was an Associate Professor and Center Assistant Director at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon, where she was an NIH-funded Principal Investigator. Her work has been published in Pediatrics, Autism Research, and other peer-reviewed journals. She has developed and taught several advanced courses and workshops on data visualization and communicating with data. Dr. Hill is also an international keynote speaker, award-winning educator, and co-author of the book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.\n\n**Marynia Kolak** is an Assistant Director of Health Informatics at the Center for Spatial Data Science at University of Chicago, where she also teaches full time as a Lecturer in Geographic Information Science. Dr. Kolak is interested in Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and using open science tools as an exploratory data analytic approach to investigate issues of equity across space and time.\n\n**Katie Fitzgerald** is a PhD Candidate in Statistics at Northwestern University. Her research is in statistical methods for social policy, including work in meta-analysis, data visualization, and statistical cognition. She is passionate about statistics education and pedagogy and is pursuing a career at a liberal arts university. When she's not doing statistics, you can find her at Northwestern’s gorgeous lakefront, biking, hammocking, reading, or indulging in good food.\n\nAgenda\n===================\nTimes are in EST\n\n7:00-7:10 Meet and Greet!\n7:10-7:25 Introduction from the panelists\n7:25-7:50 Moderated panel\n7:50-8:00 Questions from the audience\n\n** Questions?

This talk presents some of the H2Lab @UW's recent efforts to address the problem of textual comprehension and reasoning about scientific text, including knowledge extraction and claim verification given scientific articles.\nMore information: https://women-plus-datascience.github.io/\n\nKeywords\n==========\nNatural Language Processing, NLP for bio-medicine, Deep Learning, Knowledge extraction\n\nAbout the Keynote Speaker\n===================\nHanna Hajishirzi is an Assistant Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington and a Research Fellow at the Allen Institute for AI. Her research spans different areas in NLP and AI, focusing on developing machine learning algorithms that represent, comprehend, and reason about diverse forms of data at large scale. Applications for these algorithms include question answering, reading comprehension, representation learning, knowledge extraction, and conversational dialogue. Honors include the Sloan Fellowship, Allen Distinguished Investigator Award, multiple best paper and honorable mention awards, and several industry research faculty awards. Hanna received her PhD from University of Illinois and spent a year as a postdoc at Disney Research and CMU.\n\nPlanning Committee\n===========\n*Dr. Janani Ravi, Pathobiology and Diagnostic Investigation, MSU, R-Ladies East Lansing\n*Dr. Jing Liu, Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS), U-M\n*Dr. Elizabeth Munch, Department of Computational Mathematics, Science & Engineering, MSU\n*Dr. Parisa Kordjamshidi, Department of Computer Science & Engineering, MSU\n*Dr. Dola Pathak, Department of Statistics, MSU\n\nQuestions, sponsorship interests, email is at:\nwomen.plus.datascience@gmail.com",

It has a built-in shiny app and saves results to a disk. It was written to show sambas to our English and Spanish-speaking friends, and a way to practice package writing and shiny, and to learn about APIs.\n\n🎉Stephanie Hickey on BRRR (by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu)\n\n“Have you ever wanted to know - and celebrate - when your scripts are finally done running in R? Have you ever been so proud of pulling off a tricky bit of code that you wanted Flavor Flav to yell \"yeaaahhhh, boi!!\" as soon as it successfully completes? Have you ever gotten an error message that felt like DJ Khaled yelling, \"They don't wanna see us win!\" Probably not, but you might now. And with BRRR, you can.”\n\n🗺️Kayla Johnson on personalized map art\n\nMap art makes beautiful posters. You can find them all over the internet and buy them even framed for your favorite city, area or country. In this tutorial, inspired by Esteban Moro’s “Personal Art Map with R”, you’ll learn how to create those street maps for your city.\n\n♟️Sneha Sundar on chess (by Niklas Fiekas)\n\nSneha will present the chess package. chess is a wrapper for R around python-chess, an amazing library created by Niklas Fiekas. It allows users to read and write PGN files as well as create and explore game trees such as the ones seen in chess books.\n\n- Q&A | Discussion\n\n=====\nTIME\n=====\nhttps://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=RLEL%2FRLC%3A+Fun+with+R&iso=20210423T13&p1=77&ah=1&am=30",

    "description": "“Develop an R package”, they said… What does this even mean?\n\nIn this session with a live demo, we shall demystify the creation of an R package. R packages are mostly well-organized folders, and there are automatic tools to help. Let’s dive into the wonders of usethis! We shall also see why to create a package (or not). We shall furthermore explain how to improve your R package and your own package development skills. And how to solve the specific new challenges you will encounter! Last but not least we will discuss how to find your happy place in the world of R package development.\n\nDo you want to be more of a devoted maintainer of one single package? Or perhaps a valued contributor to dozens of packages?\n\n==================\nAbout the Speaker\n==================\nMaelle Salmon is a R(esearch) Software Engineer & Blogger based in Nancy, France.

    "title": "Design principles for data analysis",
    "description": "+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n**RSVP to see the Zoom registration link.**\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n**SYNOPSIS**\n[Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) will join us to talk about *design thinking* – the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a data analysis product is being designed – and how the choices a data analyst makes affect the experience of the consumer.\n\n**Title**: Design Principles for Data Analysis\n**Abstract**: The data revolution has led to an increased interest in the practice of data analysis. While much has been written about statistical thinking, a complementary form of thinking that appears in the practice of data analysis is design thinking -- the problem-solving process to understand the people for whom a solution is being designed. For a given problem, there can be significant or subtle differences in how a data analyst (or *producer* of a data analysis) constructs, creates, or designs a data analysis, including differences in the choice of methods, tooling, and workflow. These choices can affect the data analysis products themselves and the experience of the *consumer* of the data analysis. Therefore, the role of a producer can be thought of as designing the data analysis with a set of design principles. Here, we introduce *design principles for data analysis* and discuss some case studies where they were used in the classroom to characterize data analyses.\n\nRelevant preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05689](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05689__;!!HXCxUKc!htOZS1uCBo-VVA0L8WNW0s9jv2GJW74ggOL2QKX3UkkfIOWFpVim9jpHPGMPg6gP$)\n\n**PRESENTER**\n[Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.stephaniehicks.com/projects/__;!!HXCxUKc!g-4YGCinsYGNxMnNswvZMCPosWVu8U4U3dTMh1Ms9NhbsnINdMmL5iWEb2ofv-TN$), assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, is *also* giving a virtual seminar titled: \"**Scalable statistical methods and software for single-cell data science**\" in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology on **Thursday, April 14, at 11a** (email janani[AT]msu[DOT]edu for this Zoom link). One of the focuses of Dr. Hicks’ group is the analysis of high-throughput biological data, including single-cell RNA-seq data.\n\n**About RLEL**\nR-Ladies East Lansing (RLEL) is a chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org), an organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R programming community.
