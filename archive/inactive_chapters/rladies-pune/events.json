The link for live streaming : http://webcast.unipune.ac.in\n\nDr. Susan Holmes (Statistics Department, Stanford University) will be joining us for this meetup. She will talk on \"Using trees and networks in R\"\n\nAbstract:\nNetworks and trees are often used to represent both biological data\nand knowledge about a system with nodes and interactions such as social communities.\nPhylogenetic trees were used to represent family relationships between species even before Darwin's famous notebook sketch.\nNetworks are often used to schematize complex interactions between proteins involved in diseases, between community members or between neurons in the brain.\n\nShe will show examples of making effective maps and testing network and tree data using the R packages phyloseq,igraph, ggplot, ggnetwork and ggraph.",

This presentation is designed to provide practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate text into their modeling pipelines.\n\nIn this 90-minute tutorial, learn how to preprocess text data for modeling, train models, and evaluate model perform.\n\nSlides and live coding during the tutorial will be used to walk through a realistic case study.\n\nThe tutorial will be streamed, recorded, and captioned, and there will be supporting materials and code on GitHub for you to work through afterward.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nExpected level of audience’s R background:\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntermediate familiarity with R, RStudio, basics of regression and classification modeling, and tidyverse packages such as dplyr and ggplot2.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nSign up through any one of these links:\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nR-Ladies Buenos Aires: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-buenos-aires/events/271926360\n\nR-Ladies Santa Rosa: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-rosa/events/271927045/\n\nR-Ladies Ushuaia: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ushuaia/events/271932849/\n\nR-Ladies Resistencia-Corrientes: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-resistencia-corrientes/events/271931765/\n\nR-Ladies Mendoza: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-mendoza/events/271943468\n\nR-Ladies Santa Fe: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-fe/events/271948618\n\nR-Ladies General Pico: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-general-pico/events/271960751\n\nR-Ladies Córdoba: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-cordoba/events/271984839/\n\n-------------------------\nCode of Conduct:\n-------------------------\n\nAs every R-Ladies event, all participants are required to agree to the Code of Conduct.

    "title": "[Online] useR!2020 Tutorial: A ggplot2 crash course",
    "description": "(Please note, we are not hosting this event, so to register you need to follow the link towards the end of this post!)\n\nThe useR! 2020 conference has gone online this year! This has made the tutorials being conducted as a part of the conference to be accessible remotely.\n\nJoin this online tutorial to learn about creating beautiful data visualizations in R using ggplot2! Use the link at the bottom of this page to register. This tutorial is being jointly hosted by the useR! 2020 team, R-Ladies NYC and R-Ladies DC.\n\nUsers of any subject matter background who are interested in data visualization with R are welcome. New R users (less than 1 year of continual experience) will get the most out of this course. Some basic knowledge, such as understanding of different R data types & structures (character, data frame, etc.) and authoring simple functions & loops, is required. The course, however, is not just for beginners. More advanced R users who have little to no experience with ggplot2 and other packages in the tidyverse will learn many new tools for data visualization in R.\n\n---------------------\nInstructor bio:\n---------------------\n\nDr. Sam Tyner has been using ggplot2 since version 0.9.2 (2012). She co-authored and maintains the ggplot2 extension package geomnet, and has taught ggplot2 to undergraduate students, graduate students, and professionals. Her material for undergraduate students can be found at csafe-isu.github.io/reu18/slides, and a list of all workshops taught is available in her CV. Dr. Tyner also has expertise in the theory of data visualization, acquired through her dissertation research and as a part of the statistical graphics working group at Iowa State University. She has written about her ggplot2 work in The R Journal and on her blog.\n\n------------------------------------\nComputing requirements:\n------------------------------------\n\nHaving R + RStudio installed is recommended, but if this is not possible you may use the RStudio Cloud workspace. Those not using the RStudio Cloud should have the tidyverse suite of packages and the plotly package installed. Or, for the minimalist participant, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and plotly will be sufficient for the bulk of the material.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpon completion of this tutorial, participants will be able to:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Identify the appropriate plot types and corresponding ggplot2 geoms to consider when visualizing their data;\n2. Implement the ggplot2 grammar of graphics by using ggplot() and building up plots with the + operator;\n3. Iterate through multiple visualizations of their data by changing the aesthetic mappings, geometries, and other graph properties;\n4. Incorporate custom elements (colors, fonts, etc.) into their visualizations by adjusting ggplot2 theme elements;\n5. Investigate the world of ggplot2 independently to expand upon the skills learned in the course.\n\n----------------------------\nLink for registration:\n----------------------------\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/creating-beautiful-data-visualizations-in-r-a-ggplot2-crash-course-tickets-112524126692\n\n-------------------------\nCode of Conduct:\n-------------------------\n\nAs every R-Ladies event, all participants are required to agree to the Code of Conduct. In addition, we also adopt the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct.\n1.
