## üîÑ Data Pipeline

### Automated Data Collection
The repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically archive Meetup data every 12 hours:

1. **Chapter Data** (`scripts/get_chapters.R`) - Fetches current information about all R-Ladies chapters
2. **Event Data** (`scripts/get_events.R`) - Retrieves event details including dates, attendance, and topics
3. **Storage** - Data is saved as JSON in the `data/` directory and committed to the repository

### Report Generation
Reports are generated using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and support multiple output formats:
- HTML (primary format for web viewing)  
- PDF (for distribution)  
- Markdown (for Hugo static sites, intended for R-Ladies Global website integration)  

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üîê Authentication

Data collection requires Meetup API authentication via the [`meetupr`](https://github.com/rladies/meetupr) package.

For local development:
```r
# Interactive OAuth flow
meetupr::meetup_auth()
```

For GitHub Actions, set the following secrets:  
- `"meetupr:token"` - Encrypted OAuth token  
- `"meetupr:token_file"` - Token file content  

## üì¶ Dependencies

The project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) with two separate profiles:

- **`archive` profile** - Packages for data collection (`meetupr`, `httr2`, `jsonlite`, etc.)  
- **`reports` profile** - Packages for analysis and visualization (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `knitr`, etc.)
